Jenna sat on the blue couch with a sigh.

She was here for the weekend doing a job

for Mr. and Mrs. Narayan.

Jenna hoped to earn enough

for her senior ski trip.

All she needed to do was to care for

their pets while they were

away for the weekend.

Jenna's first task was to pick up

the Narayan's fluffy dog

from his vet appointment.

She stepped past the food dish

of the Narayan's lazy cat

and walked outside as small raindrops

started to fall.  Jenna didn't

mind getting wet

so she left her Toyota behind

and opened her umbrella.

She would walk

to the veterinary clinic,

which was all the way across town.

An hour later,

she walked past the bakery.

Whenever Jenna ran errands,

she would take a few moments

to treat herself.  She sat down

and lingered over a cup of coffee

and a pastry for the next hour.

Jenna then continued her journey.

She walked another mile,

coming to a pet store.

Inside, she looked around for an hour

before purchasing treats

for the Narayan's animals.

After another mile of walking,

Jenna finally came

to the veterinary clinic.

There was a long line,

so she sank down into one of the chairs.

She had to wait another thirty minutes

until her name was called.

Jenna hurriedly signed

the necessary papers

while the receptionist walked

into the back of the clinic.

Jenna smiled as she saw

the fluffy animal come galloping

into the room.

Jenna took the paperwork

from the receptionist

and walked outside.
