Wiping his brow with the kitchen towel,

the chef paused for a moment

in his preparations to survey the mess

he had created.

This meal had to be perfect,

flawless from the appetizers

to the dessert.

Not wanting to waste time,

he picked up the metal knife

and continued to prepare

the vegetables for the salad.

The timer sounded, signaling that it was

time to apply the herb rub to the roast.

The chef accidently knocked over some

plastic spoons in his hurry to whisk

the roast out of the oven.

Where did he put those spices?

How could he have forgotten

something like that

on such an important day?

He must have left them in his catering van.

The chef sat down in the kitchen

and rested his head on the counter

in discouragement.

A half hour later,

he roused himself

and plodded through the rented hall

until he reached the exit.

Slowly opening the double doors,

he started to walk up

San Francisco's steepest hill.

He strolled past a florist

and a pastry shop,

but he still had a mile to go

before he reached his van,

which was parked at the very top.

After thirty minutes of walking,

the chef was becoming very tired.

He looked downhill,

along the tracks,

but there was no trolley approaching

He continued on his journey.

His pace slowed.

It was an hour before

he finally reached his van.

He grabbed the forgotten box of spices

and breathed a sigh of relief.

The chef could envision

how everything would go.

He would first combine the spices in a bowl.

Then, he would slide the seasoned roast

back into the oven.  Finally, he would use

his metal utensil to complete

the preparations.

If tonight was successful,

he could look forward to an

exciting career in the catering business.
