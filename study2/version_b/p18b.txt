Sarah could hardly believe

that her little sister

was turning thirteen tomorrow.

As usual, she had waited until the

last minute to purchase her present.

What would a new teenager want?

Sarah recalled what was at the top

of her wish list at that age: clothes.

She was going to find her sister

the perfect outfit.

Well, maybe not an entire outfit,

but Sarah would find her

sister a perfect trendy shirt.

She wouldn't buy a paisley coat like

her mother had purchased for a gift.

Sarah had several hours before

she needed to be back home

for the birthday dinner.

She strolled out to her car.

She carefully backed out of the driveway

and drove into town.  An hour later,

Sarah arrived at the mall.

Sarah took her time

negotiating through the crowds.

She browsed for herself

before focusing on her sister.

Two hours later, Sarah had not found

anything she or her sister would like.

She returned to her car

and drove several more miles

through thick traffic.

As she passed the hair salon,

she decided that she had time

to update her highlights.

Two hours later,

she felt like a new woman.

She hopped back into her car

and drove on. She arrived at the

outlet store and made her way inside.

She spent an hour searching through

the racks of merchandise.

That's when she found it.

It was the perfect piece

of trendy clothing and she knew

her sister would love it.

Sarah pushed aside hangers

in order to look for her sister's size.

She found the correct one

and walked to the register.

She smiled, anticipating the

pleased look on her sister's face.
