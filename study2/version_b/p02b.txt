Everyone squeezed into the family room,

anxious to begin the treasure hunt,

an annual family tradition.

Joshua loved the party atmosphere

and could hardly wait

for the day's activities.

Children pushed and giggled

and the adults gossiped until

the booming voice

of the jolly uncle could be

heard over the excited crowd.

"Everyone knows how this works,"

he shouted.  "I've hidden the family trophy.

We end today's search at the park next door.

Remember, the first one to find it

receives the cash prize

and bragging rights for a year.

Same rules as always!

Ready, set... Go!"

A silly daughter pushed past everyone.

Joshua's heart fluttered in excitement.

The trophy was hidden

somewhere in the neighborhood.

Joshua wanted to be sure

he wouldn't be followed.

After a half hour of waiting,

he was finally able to

leave the house.

He crept down several streets.

Joshua peeked around a corner,

and made his way past several houses.

Twenty minutes later,

he ducked around a corner

when he spotted some cousins

in the distance.

He hid from them by crouching

behind a rock.

Thirty minutes later, he ran past

several houses, arriving at the yard

with the hollow tree.

Climbing the fence, he

tore his pants in his haste.

Joshua walked to the other side,

finally reaching the tree.  Wrong one.

He checked the other trees in the yard,

finally coming to the last one

several minutes later.

Joshua peered inside

and discovered the hidden treasure.

He took some time 

to celebrate his victory.

Then, Joshua grabbed the trophy

and strolled to the park 

three blocks down.

The jolly relative rang a large bell

to signal the end of the treasure hunt.

Once everyone had gathered in the park,

he picked up the excited boy and,

holding him high,

pronounced Joshua the winner.

The family surrounded the boy

with their congratulations;

the younger ones helping Joshua

celebrate his new windfall.

Still laughing and talking,

the family sat at the picnic table

for the celebratory meal.
