Jason looked around

his high school gymnasium.

It was overwhelmed by the

large number of booths,

each representing a different career.

He wanted to pursue a career

as a wealthy lawyer, so locating that

information table was his top priority.

He stepped around the display

that encouraged people to explore

the possibility of becoming

a caring dentist.

Jason was grateful for

the opportunity to learn more

about a variety of jobs.

His class requirement was to distribute

a minimum of three resumes

and participate in interviews today.

Jason opened his bag

to remove his resumes.

He was irritated to realize

that he had forgotten them at home.

Unfortunately, his home was several

miles away.  Before leaving, however,

Jason spent an hour just wandering

around the gymnasium

looking at the displays.

Frustrated he didn't have

his resumes to hand out,

he exited the gym and began

the long walk home. After a mile,

he came to a park.

He was hot,

and purchased an ice cream cone.

He sat on the bench and ate it slowly.

Feeling tired, he stretched out

and took a nap on the bench.

When he awoke, he continued his trip.

It took another half hour

to walk past the high school

with its many athletic fields.

He was tired when he finally arrived

at his house.  He picked through

the stack of newspapers

on the coffee table.

Thirty minutes later, he

found his stack of resumes

under the papers.

Jason was relieved he had

the necessary paperwork to start looking

into the wealthy career he was

interested in. 

He stuffed the stack of resumes

in his bag.
