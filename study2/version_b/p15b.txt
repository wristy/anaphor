Jessie was excited to hear the results

after her husband's participation

in yesterday's competition.

She knew that her husband grew

the sweetest apples anywhere.

The judges had already sampled them

at the state fair yesterday

and would meet with everyone today

to share the results.

Jessie stepped past

a table of tangy lemons

and entered the competition area.

She needed to locate her husband at the

judge's table before the judges arrived.

Jessie took out her cell phone

and called her husband.

She hoped he could give her

clear directions to his location.

After a brief and tense conversation,

she realized that she was

on the wrong side of the vast fair!

Jessie hung up her phone and decided

to enjoy this side of the fair

before she met her husband.

First, she waited in line for

a half hour to get lemonade.

For the next hour,

she wandered among the booths.

When she had seen everything

she wanted to see,

Jessie strolled back to her car.

She drove the two miles

to the other side of fair,

where her husband was.

The traffic was a mess.

Forty-five minutes later, Jessie

finally arrived at her destination.

She perused the countless brown tables

covered in hearty food.

She stopped to use the restroom

and had to wait in the

longest line she had ever seen.

A half hour later, she finally joined

her husband at the judge's table

just in time to see the 

three judges approach.

Jessie was ecstatic when

her husband's sweet fruit was announced

as the grand prize winner.

She jumped up and down

in excitement as the oldest judge

handed her husband a blue ribbon!
