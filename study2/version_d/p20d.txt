The warrior slowly awakened

with the morning sun, unprepared for the

battle that was still hours away.       

He threw on his cotton scarf,

bothered not at all by its

tattered condition or egregious smell.

He set aside his leather gloves

and spent the next few hours

polishing his armor

before finally putting it on.

He had fought many battles in his life,

and had come close to dying several times.

Today's battle was just a game, however;

a competition to determine

the best man in the land.

He had fought many men over the years,

many stronger than him.

He had vanquished them all because combat

is not about deploying one's strengths.

Rather, it is about exploiting

your opponent's weaknesses.

These thoughts occupied him for hours.

After this contemplation, the warrior

realized that it would be a long time

until his next meal.  He slowly

walked through the village

in search of his favorite inn.

The warrior sat down to a bit of ale

and an old drumstick.  This was his

traditional meal before battle.

He had actually come to hate drumsticks,

but was far too superstitious to change

his menu at this point in his life.

He methodically consumed the few morsels

for the energy they provided.  Afterwards,

he resumed his long journey.

He traveled for several hours before

stopping beside a peaceful brook.

The warrior sank his hands into the water.

He then wiped his soiled fingers

on his cotton clothing before changing

into his armor and preparing himself

for battle.
