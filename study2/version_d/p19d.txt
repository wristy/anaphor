The woman huddled on the floor.  She

watched the three men shatter the glass

jewelry case with the butts of their guns.

The men scooped the glitzy opals

into black velvet bags.

The woman was hidden behind the case

filled with crimson garnets.  

She was close to the door that

the robbers had carelessly left open.

Although scared, she decided to escape

and to try to find help.  

The woman grabbed her purse and

slowly crawled across the floor.

A half hour passed before the robbers

were distracted enough

for her to pass through the door frame.

She crawled slowly, careful to avoid

jostling the door.  Once outside,

she proceeded cautiously down the street,

keeping to the shadows to avoid

being spotted by a lookout.

A half hour later, she came to a bank.

She tried to find help, but it was closed.

She continued carefully down the road.

Not finding anyone, she cut across

a construction site.  She tripped over

a concrete block, hit her head on a girder,

and sunk into unconsciousness.

When she finally woke several hours later,

her head really hurt.  At this point,

she finally remembered

the cell phone in her pocket.

Feeling stupid, she retrieved it

and carefully dialed 911.

A little while later,

she told the operators that a robbery

had taken place. She also mentioned

that the thieves

had taken glitzy gems from

the jewelry store.  

The woman closed her cell phone.

She was exhausted.

She breathed a sigh of relief,

thankful that she'd been able to escape

and call for help.
