Delilah and Joseph were in the process

of moving from Chicago to London.

The biggest remaining task

was to pack their apartment.

The many smaller items had

already been packed. All that remained

were a couple of the bigger items.

They grabbed the wooden futon in the

dining room and began to

dissemble it together.  Joseph searched

the remaining empty boxes

for one that was big enough.

He was glad that they already packed

the bulky recliner.

Glancing at the clock,

Delilah realized that their friends

would be coming over to help them in

three hours.  They had plenty of time.

It took half an hour for Joseph to sort

through the remaining boxes.

None were big enough. Joseph grabbed

his keys and headed to the parking lot.

After two miles of heavy traffic,

he passed a post office.  He parked and

stood in the long line to

get a change-of-address form.

He filled it out, dropped it in the slot,

and continued on his way.

A few more miles in the heavy traffic

brought him to the bank.  He remembered

that he needed to get money

to pay the movers.  He parked in the

crowded lot and waited in the long line.

A half hour later, the teller finally

gave him his money. Back on the road,

he found the traffic

even heavier than before.

It took an hour to travel

the final two miles to the shipping store.

It was very crowded, and it took forever

to locate a sufficiently large packing box.

There was only one cashier

and it took forever to pay for the box.

Joseph was about to head back

to help Delilah pack the pieces of

the wooden furniture when his phone

rang.  It was Delilah calling

to let him know that the "reinforcements"

had arrived.
