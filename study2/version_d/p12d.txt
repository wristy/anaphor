Jason and Jenna smiled at each other.

It was a wonderful date so far.

They climbed out of the vintage schooner.

Jason and Jenna walked past a tiny kayak

tied to the dock in front of them

and continued their date. 

They were both hungry and eager

for their lunch reservation

after spending time on the water.

The restaurant was several miles

away at the other end of town.

Their reservation was in a few hours,

so Jason and Jenna took their time

strolling through

the picturesque streets.

They both had gotten sunburned

out on the water, so they stopped

in the drug store to purchase some aloe.

The store was crowded,

and it took thirty minutes to find

what they were looking for

and complete the purchase.

As they continued walking,

they spotted a wine store.

They walked into it and spent

the next hour tasting different wines

before settling on a bottle

to purchase and bring to lunch.

They held hands and slowly walked

the last mile to the restaurant,

arriving thirty minutes

late for their reservation.

As they were shown to their table,

Jason asked Jenna which part of

their date she liked the best so far.

Jenna quickly said that she had

really enjoyed her time

in the vintage vessel best

but that everything else had been

lovely as well.  Then, Jason

and Jenna picked up the menu

and they prepared to order.
