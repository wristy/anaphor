Keisha looked around

the bus stop with a sigh.

She couldn't believe her car

had broken down again.

She sat on a wooden bench

and pulled out her glossy pamphlet.

The bench cut into the backs of her legs

since she wasn't tall enough

for her feet to touch the ground.

She pushed aside a tattered comic

and settled in to wait for the 8:57 bus.

She waited and waited but

the bus never came.

After a half hour,

she realized that she had missed it.

She had no other choice but to wait

patiently for the 10:25 bus.

It arrived almost an hour later.

Tired and late for work,

she took a seat near the front.

The traffic was heavy,

and the bus started to crawl

the few miles to her work.

After one mile, it stopped

in front of the bakery.

Several people slowly boarded.

The bus continued along its slow journey.

After another mile, it stopped

in front of the grocery store.

A large number of passengers

boarded there.  One mile later,

the bus gave a jolt and rolled to a stop.

It took an hour for a mechanic to arrive.

It took another hour

for him to fix the problem.

Eventually, the bus

shuddered back to life.

The traffic was still heavy.

A half hour later, the bus finally

stopped in front of her work.

At that moment, she realized

that she had left

her glossy reading material on

the bench at the bus stop.

She crossed her fingers that her car

would be fixed by that afternoon,

and she would be able to drive to work.
