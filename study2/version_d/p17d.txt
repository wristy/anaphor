It was late at night when Ryan,

a rookie cop, responded to the call.

He was eager to start the process

that could eventually lead to an arrest.

Ryan scanned the scene.

His eyes immediately landed on the

bloody club lying ominously in the doorway.

The only other scene he had investigated

was one involving a silver axe.

He reached for his kit

for processing crime scenes.

Just then, he remembered that he

had left his kit

for processing crime scenes at home.

Ryan's superiors hadn't arrived yet,

so he took his time walking to his car.

Ryan climbed in and started to drive

the several miles back to his house.

The football game had just ended,

and the traffic was heavy.

A half hour later,

Ryan passed a gas station.

His tank was almost empty,

so he pulled in and filled it up.

The credit card machine was broken

so he had to wait in line

to pay inside.  Afterwards,

Ryan realized that he was hungry.

He spent the next thirty minutes

searching for a deli

that was still open.

When he found one,

he bought a sandwich

and a soft drink.

He took them to the park across

the street and enjoyed the snack.

When he finally arrived at his house,

it took him an hour to find his kit. 

Mentally, Ryan prepared himself for

the next steps he would take

in processing the scene.

He would start by analyzing

the bloody weapon that he found

at the house.  He would have to use

the equipment to dust for fingerprints.

Ryan knew that if he worked methodically,

his thorough approach would produce results

that would help to apprehend the guilty.
