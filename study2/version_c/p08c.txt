A soft breeze swirled

Tamika's skirt around her ankles.

The only sound in the cemetery

was the whispering leaves.

Tamika wiped a tear from her cheek

as she stood by her mother's grave.

Her mother's favorite flowers

were white orchids. Tamika placed

a bouquet of them on the grave.

Tamika stepped past the purple tulips

at the gated entrance.

She paused at a bench

outside the cemetery.

She wasn't in a hurry

to leave her hometown.

She was meeting her friend for lunch

in a neighboring town, but

that wasn't for several hours.

As usual, Tamika was overwhelmed

by emotions and memories.

She closed her eyes

and began to meditate.

When she was completely calm, she

exhaled deeply and checked her watch.

Two hours had gone by! 

She crossed the street, got in her car,

and set off.  At the outskirts of town,

she stopped for a cup of coffee.

Tamika savored her warm beverage

over the next hour.  When it was finished,

she returned to her car

and covered the remaining miles

to the next town.  The cafe was

very busy and Tamika had to wait

for a half hour before she was

finally seated.  Finally,

she plopped down in a seat and sighed.

Even though it had been a difficult visit,

Tamika was happy that she had put

the white flowers on the headstone

of her mother's grave.

She was sure that her mother

would enjoy looking down

on those beautiful blooms

dancing in the breeze.
