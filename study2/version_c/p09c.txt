Sirens sounded in the distance.

The criminal knew

the authorities were closing in.

He used a rusty chisel to pry open

the old basement window.

He stepped over

the cordless drill on the floor

and started to climb out of the window.

However, he saw lights so he retreated back

inside. He sprinted through the house.

The criminal burst through the front door.

He knew he was safe from the authorities

because the entrance was

completely hidden by tall hedges.

He paused for a moment, wondering what

he could do to evade the law.

Logic dictated that he stick to the shadows

and proceed at a slow and deliberate pace,

to avoid being discovered.

The criminal used his common sense and

started crawling.  It was the only option.

After several agonizing hours,

he came to a wooded area one mile away.

The criminal slowly made his way

through the trees.  He crawled and crept

for another hour.  Finally,

he came to a park another mile away.

Suddenly, he heard sirens. He ducked inside

a tube slide to hide.  He prayed that

his hiding spot wouldn't be discovered.

It was too dangerous to travel now,

so he settled in for a nap.

Waking several hours later,

the criminal left his hiding place behind.

He crept through the neighborhood until

he found a seemingly abandoned house.

The sun was beginning

to rise as he paused 

to catch his breath and listen.

The criminal decided it was safe

to break into the house.

He struggled to open a side window.

The criminal wished he still had

the rusty tool to help him

in his efforts.  After he got inside,

he tiptoed around.  When he arrived

in the kitchen, his heart sank

when he saw two officers waiting to

apprehend him.
