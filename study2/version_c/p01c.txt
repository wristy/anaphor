Sophia straightened her suit,

took a deep breath,

and entered the hotel's bar,

just off the lobby.  She took a seat

at an empty high-top table.

She ordered an amber scotch,

hoping to calm her nerves.

The waitress arrived

carrying Sophia's drink as well as an

expensive wine. She set Sophia's order

on the table and moved on.

Before Sophia could even take a sip,

her cell phone rang.

It was the client

calling to confirm their meeting

in the lobby of the Madison Hotel.

The Madison Hotel? 

Sophia was sitting

in the wrong hotel.

The Madison was

several miles away!

She maintained her composure

and assured the client

that their meeting together

would begin in two hours.

Sophia hung up her phone

and reviewed her papers

for the next hour before she

left the hotel.

By this time, it was

raining heavily outside.

Sophia stopped at

the drugstore down the block

to buy an umbrella.

The store was crowded and

it took half an hour

to complete the purchase.

Stepping back onto the street,

she decided to walk

instead of taking a cab.

This would give her time

to find her focus.

An hour later, Sophia finally

arrived at the Madison Hotel.

Despite her umbrella,

she was soaking wet so

she headed to the restroom

to freshen up.

A half hour later,

Sophia walked through the lobby

where she saw the client

impatiently waiting.

He rose from his chair

and instantly launched into a list

of his complaints.

Sophia pasted a smile on her face

and found herself wishing

for the amber beverage she left

back in the bar.  

She mentally prepared herself for 

what was sure to be a difficult meeting.
