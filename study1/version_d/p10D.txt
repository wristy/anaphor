Following the doctor's visit,

the tension in the hospital room

was palpable.  All the parents

could hear was the echo of the doctor's

diagnosis: their daughter was battling

an aggressive cancer.  There was so

much sadness here.  Of course,

it could have been worse.

The parents were eager to do something

to cheer up their daughter.

They decided to find something that

would make her smile when she woke up.

The father remembered the gift store

that he and his wife had seen.

The father decided to buy their daughter

a new teddy bear.

His wife asked him to go

to the gift store that was

several blocks away.  She could see

that he was emotionally drained,

and thought he could use

a couple of hours to regain his strength.

The father plodded through the 7th floor

of the hospital in a state of shock.

He waited a long time for the elevator.

When he finally got to the lobby,

he saw his neighbors holding

colorful balloons for his daughter.

The father broke the devastating news

to the group.  It took an hour to answer

all of their questions. When he finished,

he exited the hospital.

He slowly walked the several blocks

to the gift store.

When he finally arrived,

he found the place packed with customers.

His purchase took a half hour.

As he exited the store,

he tucked the teddy bear under his arm

and took a deep breath.

He knew they could be strong

as they fought this 

aggressive disease as a family.

Together, they would

make it through this.
