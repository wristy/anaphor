The two girls had never been to the zoo.

This trip with their father, Jared,

would be the first.

The girls endlessly reminded their father

that they had to see the fierce lion

while they were there.

Jared reminded his girls

of the other animals that they could see

but the girls would not be

distracted from their goal.

They lumbered around their house as

they tried to get ready to go.

The girls complained long and hard

about brushing their teeth.

Twenty minutes later,

they finally consented to this chore.

After combing their hair,

the family was finally ready

to leave the house.

They were already an hour

behind schedule! They piled into

the family's minivan.

Traffic was heavy, and it took

another hour to cover

the ten miles to the zoo.

When they arrived,

Jared searched the parking lot.

The only parking spot

was far from the zoo's entrance.

He grabbed his girls by their hands

and they slowly made

their way to the exhibit.

Jumping up and down in excitement,

the girls could finally see

the fierce animal in the distance.

After the girls had their fill

of looking at that exhibit,

they smiled with satisfaction.

The zoo had been a success.
