The music instructor looked outside.

The snow that was falling

beyond her window was dense and wet.

Running her fingers lovingly

over the shabby piano, she sighed.

She prepared for the day.

She was already cold when

she struggled into her coat.

The music instructor traveled miles

every day so she could give students

lessons in their homes.

Today she dreaded leaving her home.

She put her cell phone in her pocket

and walked outside.

She grabbed the shovel by the door

and cleared the driveway.

She then started on her ten-mile trip

through the elements.  She drove

carefully to the house

of her first student, Anya.

It took longer than usual,

but at least she arrived safely.

Anya's lesson was an hour long,

but she was a poor student,

and the time passed very slowly.

When she finished, she backed

out of the driveway and drove

three more miles to her next lesson

at Amy's house.  Amy was a much

better student.  She made a lot

of progress over the next hour

with the music instructor's help.

The instructor drove two more miles

until she reached her final lesson

at Jose's house.

The hour-long lesson was very frustrating.

She returned to her car

and started the engine.

She was exhausted from the long day.

She looked forward

to spending the evening in the

warmth of her home, her fingers dancing

over the shabby instrument she loved.

She couldn't wait to ease

into a familiar aria,

letting her eyes drift closed

so she could completely enjoy

the music as she played.

She hoped that someday

one of her students would find

the release and comfort that she did

when she sat down on the bench.
