The aviation mechanic buried his head

in his work rag.  He attempted to

soak up some of the sweat

streaming down his face.

He had forgotten a few of his tools,

including the one he needed

for this repair.

He kicked the plastic chair.

He longed for the days

when he was part of a

line maintenance crew,

making the simple checks and adjustments

necessary before take-offs.

He was up against a deadline,

and he froze with fear.

It took him a half hour

to calm down.

He exited the hangar.

He trudged off toward his car

in the remote parking lot,

where he kept his toolbox.

A half hour later, he strolled

past the control tower.

He paused to dissect last night's game

with his friend.  They talked for an hour

before Sam had to get back to work.

The mechanic walked past the main office

to pick up his paycheck.

This took a half hour because of

all of the paperwork.

He then made his way past the terminal,

getting caught up in the mob of travelers.

He continued to his car

on the far side of the parking lot.

The mechanic opened the trunk

and rummaged through his toolbox.

It took forever to locate the forgotten tool.

Tired and hot, he thought about his problem

controlling his temper.

He felt foolish for kicking

the plastic furniture earlier,

when he was frustrated.

Experience had told him

that simple mistakes

were nothing to get upset about.

Problems usually

resolved themselves in the end.
