Following the doctor's visit,

The tension in the hospital room

was palpable.  All the parents

could hear was the echo of the doctor's

diagnosis: their daughter was battling

an aggressive cancer.  There was so

much sadness here.  Of course,

it could have been worse.

The parents were eager to do something

to cheer up their daughter.

They decided to find something that

would make her smile when she woke up.

The father remembered the gift store

that he and his wife had seen.

The father decided to buy their daughter

a new teddy bear.

His wife asked him to go to

the gift store just down the hall

from the daughter's room.

She told him to take his time,

to take a couple of hours

to regain his strength.

The father plodded down the 7th floor

of the hospital in a state of shock.

He leaned against the wall and

closed his eyes.  He was tired

of the uncertainty.  Over the next hour,

he tried to think about happier times.

As he opened his eyes,

he saw his neighbors coming to visit

his daughter. They had brought balloons.

The father shared the devastating news.

It took an hour to answer

all of their questions. When he finished,

he walked the few remaining steps

to the gift store.  A number of customers

were in the store, and it took

a half hour to make his purchase.

As he exited the store,

he took a deep breath.

He knew they could be strong

as they fought this 

aggressive disease as a family.

Together, they would

make it through this.
