The woman huddled on the floor.  She

watched the three men shatter the glass

jewelry case with the butts of their guns.

The men scooped the glitzy diamonds

into black velvet bags.

The woman was close to the door that

the robbers had carelessly left open.

Although scared, she decided to escape

and to try to find help.  

The woman grabbed her purse and slowly

crawled across the floor.

A half hour passed before the robbers

were distracted enough for her to pass

through the door frame.

She crawled slowly, careful to avoid

jostling the door.  Once outside,

she carefully made her way

to the side of the building.

The woman decided she'd be safe

hiding there in the shadows.

She spent the next half hour

trying to calm her racing heart.

In her panic, the woman couldn't seem

to catch her breath.

She was hyperventilating!

The combination of the crime and

the heat got the best of her,

and she passed out.

She awoke two hours later.

Finally, she remembered

the cell phone in her pocket.

She retrieved it and carefully

dialed 911. A little while later,

she told the operator

that a robbery had taken place. 

She also mentioned that thieves

had taken glitzy gems.  The woman

closed her cell phone, exhausted.

She breathed a sigh of relief,

thankful that she had been able to escape

and call for help.
