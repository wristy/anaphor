Keisha looked around

the bus stop with a sigh.

She couldn't believe her car

had broken down again.

She sat on a wooden bench

and pulled out her glossy paperback.

The bench cut into the backs of her legs

since she wasn't tall enough

for her feet to touch the ground.

She settled in to wait for the 8:57 bus.

She waited and waited

but the bus never came.

After a half hour,

she realized that she had missed it.

She had no other choice

but to wait for the 10:25 bus.

Just then, her phone rang.

It was her mother, who loved to talk.

It took an hour before

Keisha could say goodbye

and get off the phone.

The 10:25 bus had yet to arrive.

Keisha decided to just walk the block

to her work.  Keisha stood up

and grabbed her things.

She took a moment to stretch her legs.

She had been sitting on the bench

for almost two hours,

and her knees were quite stiff.

She slowly walked

the two blocks to her office.

She arrived at work twenty minutes later.

At that moment, she realized that she

had left her glossy book on the bench

at the bus stop.

She crossed her fingers that her car

would be fixed by that afternoon,

and she would be able to drive to work.
