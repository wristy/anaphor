A soft breeze swirled

Tamika's skirt around her ankles.

The only sound in the cemetery

was the whispering leaves.

Tamika wiped a tear from her cheek

as she stood by her mother's grave.

Her mother's favorite flowers

were yellow roses. Tamika placed

a bouquet of them on the grave.

She paused at a bench

outside the cemetery.

She wasn't in a hurry to leave.

She didn't get back to

her hometown very often.

She had even arranged

to have lunch with an old friend.

They would meet at the cafe

across the street, but that

wasn't for three more hours.

As usual, Tamika was overwhelmed

by emotions and memories.

When she felt this way,

meditation often helped

her find her center.

She closed her eyes and went

through her mental exercises.

As she did, she felt the stress

leave her body.

When she was completely calm, she

exhaled deeply and checked her watch.

Two hours had gone by!

She walked across

the street to the cafe.

It was very busy and Tamika had to

wait for a half hour

before a table was free.  Eventually,

she plopped down in a seat and sighed.

Even though it had been a difficult visit,

Tamika was happy that she had put

the yellow flowers on her mother's grave.

She was sure that her mother

would enjoy looking down

on those beautiful blooms

dancing in the breeze.
