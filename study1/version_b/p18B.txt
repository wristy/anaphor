Sarah could hardly believe

that her little sister

was turning thirteen tomorrow.

As usual, she had waited until the

last minute to purchase her present.

What would a new teenager want?

Sarah recalled what was at the top

of her wish list at that age: clothes.

She was going to find her sister

the perfect outfit.

Well, maybe not an entire outfit,

but Sarah would find her

a pair of trendy pants.

Sarah had several hours before

she needed to be back home

for the birthday dinner.

She was glad she had come to this store

to search for her sister's present.

It was a chic boutique that catered

to the tastes of the young and the

fashionable.  First, Sarah searched

the store for something for herself.

She tried on racks of coats for an hour

without any luck.

She then switched to shoes.

An hour and many pairs later,

still no luck.  Exhausted, she finally

shifted her focus to her sister's present.

Sarah spent the next hour

re-evaluating the store's inventory.

It was tiring pushing through

the thick crowds. She had almost lost hope

when she came to the last rack.

That's where she found it.

It was the perfect piece

of trendy clothing.  Sarah knew

her sister would love it.

She pushed aside hangers

in order to look for her sister's size.

She found the correct one

and walked to the register.

She smiled, anticipating the

pleased look on her sister's face.
