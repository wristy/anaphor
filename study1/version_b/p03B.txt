Wiping his brow with the kitchen towel,

the chef paused for a moment

in his preparations to survey the mess

he had created.

This meal had to be perfect,

flawless from the appetizers

to the dessert.

Not wanting to waste time,

he picked up the gleaming knife

and continued to cut

the vegetables for the salad.

The timer sounded, signaling that it was

time to apply the herb rub to the roast.

Where did he put those spices?

How could he have forgotten

something like that

on such an important day?

He must have left them in his catering van.

Discouraged, the chef couldn't believe

that he wasn't prepared for this.

Some of the city's

most important people would be

attending this dinner.

These worries occupied the chef's mind

for quite awhile.

An hour later, a florist arrived

to deliver the centerpieces.

The chef spent a long time

arguing with the florist about

the best placement for the flowers

as they set up the tables.

Over an hour later,

a pastry chef arrived

with the desserts for the event.

The chef stood up

to look at the desserts.

He spent a half hour talking to the chef

about a future event

he was catering where

he would also need desserts.

It was then that he spotted his

box of spices

sitting on the first table!

He must have set it down

on his way into the kitchen.

The chef straightened his shoulders.

He could envision how everything would go.

He would first combine the spices in a bowl.

Then, he would slide the seasoned roast

back into the oven.  Finally, he would use

his gleaming utensil to complete

the preparations.

If tonight was successful,

he could look forward to an

exciting career in the catering business.
