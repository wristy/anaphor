Jason looked around

his high school gymnasium.

It was overwhelmed by the

large number of booths,

each representing a different career.

He wanted to pursue a career

in the field of education

as a motivating teacher, so locating that

information table was his top priority.

Jason was grateful for

the opportunity to learn more

about a variety of jobs.

His class requirement was to distribute

a minimum of three resumes

and participate in interviews today.

Many of his classmates were frustrated

with this requirement.

Jason was one of them.

He joined a couple of friends

in the corner of the gym.

They spent an hour complaining about

having to attend this event.

When his friends departed, Jason had

no excuse to not participate

in the career fair.

He slowly made his way across the gym.

He hoped he remembered

to bring his paperwork.  In particular,

he needed his resumes

so that he could distribute them.

Jason had spent a tremendous amount of time

collecting the requisite information,

and formatting it in an appealing way.

He was going to be in big trouble

if he didn't have them.

Jason dumped out

the entire contents of his bag

onto the gymnasium floor.

A half hour later, he 

found his stack of resumes

under the papers.

Jason was relieved he had

the necessary paperwork to start looking

into the motivating career he was

interested in. 

He stuffed the stack of resumes

in his bag.
