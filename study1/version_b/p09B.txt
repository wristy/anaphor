Sirens sounded in the distance.

The criminal knew

the authorities were closing in.

He used a rusty hammer to pry open

the old basement window.

He started to climb out of the window

but saw lights, so he retreated back

inside. He sprinted through the house.

The criminal burst through the front door.

He knew he was safe from the authorities

because the entrance was

completely hidden by tall hedges.

He paused for a moment, wondering what

he could do to evade the law.

Logic dictated that he stick to the shadows

and proceed at a slow and deliberate pace,

to avoid being discovered.

The criminal used his common sense

and did not run.  He thought about

his options for the next half hour,

shielded by the tall hedges.

He needed to be smart about

what he did next.  His decision could

mean the difference between

freedom and jail.

After lengthy deliberation,

the criminal decided it was safest

to remain where he was.

He retreated even deeper into the hedges.

An hour later, he heard sirens.

He hoped his hiding spot

wouldn't be discovered.  It was too

dangerous to do anything now, so

he settled in for a nap.

He didn't wake until several hours later.

The criminal left his hiding place behind

and crawled to the house next door.

The sun was beginning

to rise as he paused 

to catch his breath and listen.

The criminal decided it was safe

to break into the house.

He struggled to open a side window.

The criminal wished he still had

the rusty tool to help him in his efforts.

After he got inside, he tiptoed around.

When he got to the kitchen

his heart sank when he saw two officers

waiting to apprehend him.
