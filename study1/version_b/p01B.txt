Sophia straightened her suit,

took a deep breath,

and entered the hotel's bar,

just off the lobby.  She took a seat

at an empty high-top table.

She ordered an amber beer,

hoping to calm her nerves.

The waitress set Sophia's drink 

on the table and moved on.

Before Sophia could even take a sip,

her cell phone rang.

It was the client

calling to confirm their meeting

in the lobby of the Madison Hotel.

Sophia checked her watch

and confirmed that their meeting

would begin in two hours.

She hung up her phone

and took a deep breath.

Sophia was not looking forward to

meeting with this client.

She spent the next half hour

recalling how their

last interaction had gone.

His arrogant attitude always

put her on edge.

Sophia made room

on the table for some papers and

dumped the contents

of her briefcase in front of her.

She spent over an hour

sorting through the documents

and rehearsing her presentation.

Then, Sophia realized

she couldn't possibly be more prepared

than she already was.

Sophia signaled for the check 

and waited fifteen minutes 

for the waitress to total her tab.  

She walked slowly out of the bar

and into the lobby.

Sophia sighed when she noticed

the client already sitting

in a chair, waiting.

He rose from his chair

and instantly launched into a list

of his complaints.

Sophia pasted a smile on her face

and found herself wishing

for the amber beverage she left

back in the bar.  

She mentally prepared herself for 

what was sure to be a difficult meeting.
