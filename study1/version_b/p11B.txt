The music instructor looked outside.

The snow that was falling

beyond her window was dense and wet.

Running her fingers lovingly

over the shabby piano, she sighed.

She prepared for the day.

She was already cold

so she wrapped another sweater

around her thin shoulders.

The day's lessons were about to begin.

Students traveled to her home

for lessons every day.

The music instructor

liked this arrangement.

It was convenient because she didn't

have to leave her home.

The music instructor had to wait

half an hour for her first

student to arrive.

Anya's lesson was an hour long,

but she was poorly prepared,

and the time passed very slowly.

There was a half hour gap

before the next student arrived.

Amy was a much better student.

She made a lot of progress

over the next hour with

the music instructor's help.

That left the music instructor

with only one more lesson for the day:

Jose.  Jose was late as usual.

Not surprisingly, he had not practiced

since she saw him last.  The hour-long

lesson was very frustrating.

As she closed the door behind him,

she pondered whether to continue

as his teacher.  By this time

in the day, the music instructor

was exhausted.  Her work was done

and now she looked forward

to spending the evening in the

warmth of her home, her fingers dancing

over the shabby instrument she loved.

She couldn't wait to ease

into a familiar aria,

letting her eyes drift closed

so she could completely enjoy

the music as she played.

She hoped that someday

one of her students would find

the release and comfort that she did

when she sat down on the bench.
