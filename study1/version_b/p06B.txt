The aviation mechanic buried his head

in his work rag.  He attempted to

soak up some of the sweat

streaming down his face.

He had forgotten a few of his tools,

including the one he needed

for this repair.

He kicked the plastic chair.

He longed for the days

when he was part of a

line maintenance crew,

making the simple checks and adjustments

necessary before take-offs.

He was up against a deadline,

and he froze with fear.

It took him a half hour to calm down.

The mechanic looked around the hangar.

He spent several minutes

mourning the time he would lose

looking for his tool.  Eventually,

he forced himself into action.

The mechanic was about to trudge off

toward his car when he tripped

over his toolbox.

As he got back to his feet,

he saw his friend Sam

walking over for a visit.

They spent a couple of hours

dissecting last night's game.

When Sam finally left,

the mechanic bent down

to rummage through his toolbox.

It took forever

to locate the forgotten tool.

Tired and hot, he rose to his feet.

He thought about his problem

controlling his temper.

He felt foolish for kicking

the plastic furniture earlier,

when he was frustrated.

Experience had told him

that simple mistakes

were nothing to get upset about.

Problems usually

resolved themselves in the end.
