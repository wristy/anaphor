The two girls had never been to the zoo.

This trip with their father, Jared,

would be the first.

The girls endlessly reminded their father

that they had to see the fierce lion

while they were there.

Jared reminded his girls

of the other animals that they could see

but the girls would not be

distracted from their goal.

Jared helped his girls examine

the zoo map at the entrance.

The girls giggled as they

made it a race to see

who could find the exhibit first.

Jared saw this as an opportunity.

He spent the next hour teaching

the girls how to read a map.

The girls turned it into a game

and asked Jared to quiz them

by asking them to find

different locations on the map.

An hour passed before the older girl

finally found the exhibit.

The exhibit was only a few yards away.

She grabbed her younger sister's hand

and pulled on Jared's coat.

The girls started running but then

Jared called for them to slow down.

Rounding a bend,

they came to the exhibit.

Jumping up and down in excitement,

the girls could finally see

the fierce animal in the distance.

After the girls had their fill

of looking at that exhibit,

they smiled with satisfaction.

The zoo had been a success.
