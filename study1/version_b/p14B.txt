Jenna sat on the blue couch with a sigh.

She was here for the weekend doing a job

for Mr. and Mrs. Narayan.

Jenna hoped to earn enough

for her senior ski trip.

All she needed to do was to care for

their pets while they were

away for the weekend.

Jenna's first task was to pick up

the Narayan's friendly dog

from his vet appointment.

She walked outside

as small raindrops

started to fall.  Jenna didn't

mind getting wet so

she left her Toyota behind

and opened her umbrella.

She would walk to the veterinary clinic,

which was just a couple blocks away.

Jenna strolled down the driveway.

At the end of the driveway,

she stood with her eyes closed

and listened to the sound

of the rain hitting her umbrella.

She loved that sound.

A half hour later,

Jenna started her stroll to the vet.

Jenna had to be very careful

where she stepped because deep puddles

had formed, and she didn't want

to ruin her shoes.  She didn't mind

her slow progress though;

she loved the rain.

Finally, Jenna walked

into the veterinary clinic.

There was a long line,

so she sank down into one of the chairs.

She had to wait another thirty minutes

until her name was called.

Jenna hurriedly signed

the necessary papers

while the receptionist walked

into the back of the clinic.

Jenna smiled as she saw

the friendly animal come galloping

into the room.

Jenna took the leash

from the receptionist

and walked outside.
