Delilah and Joseph were in the process

of moving from Chicago to London.

The biggest remaining task

was to pack their apartment.

The many smaller items had

already been packed. All that remained

were a couple of the bigger items.

They grabbed the wooden table in the

dining room and began to

dissemble it together.  Joseph searched

the remaining empty boxes

for one that was big enough.

Glancing at the clock,

Delilah realized that their friends

would be coming over to help them

in three hours.  They had plenty of time.

It took half an hour for Joseph

to sort through the remaining boxes.

None was big enough.  Joseph saw

his wife's distress.

He needed to find a solution

to the problem.  Just then,

he remembered something.

He told Delilah that he had purchased

a large packing box yesterday

that he hadn't put with the others.

It was just across the hall

in their storage locker.

Relieved, they decided to enjoy lunch

before continuing.  Delilah grabbed

the leftovers from the refrigerator,

and they sat on the floor

and shared a small meal.

Tired and full, they laid down

for a power nap and were soon asleep.

They woke a few hours later.

Joseph rubbed the sleep from his eyes

and stepped across the hall.

It took him awhile to find the large

cardboard box in the storage locker.

Joseph was about to head back

to help Delilah pack the pieces of

the wooden furniture when his phone rang.

It was Delilah calling to let him know

that the "reinforcements" had arrived.
