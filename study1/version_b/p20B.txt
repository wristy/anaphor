The warrior slowly awakened with

the morning sun, unprepared for the 

battle that was still hours away.  

He threw on his wool shirt,

bothered not at all by its

tattered condition or egregious smell.

He spent the next few hours

polishing his armor before finally 

putting it on.  He had fought

many battles in his life,

and had come close to dying several times.

Today's battle was just a game, however;

a competition to determine

the best man in the land.  He had fought

many men over the years,

many stronger than him.

He had vanquished them all because combat

is not about deploying one's strengths.

Rather, it is about exploiting

your opponent's weaknesses.

These thoughts occupied him for hours.

After this contemplation,

the warrior realized it would be

a long time until his next meal.

He carefully examined

his stack of provisions.

The warrior sat down to a bit of ale and

an old drumstick.  This was his 

traditional meal before battle.

He had actually come to hate

drumsticks, but was far too superstitious

to change his menu at this point

in his life.  He methodically consumed the

few morsels for the energy they provided.

Tired, he settled in and enjoyed a long,

leisurely nap.  When he woke much later, 

he walked to the large bowl 

of water in the corner and dropped

to his knees.  The warrior sank 

his hands into the water.

He then wiped his soiled fingers

on his wool clothing.  Finally,

he changed into his armor

and prepared himself for battle.
