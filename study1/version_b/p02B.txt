Everyone squeezed into the family room,

anxious to begin the treasure hunt,

an annual family tradition.

Joshua loved the party atmosphere

and could hardly wait

for the day's activities.

Children pushed and giggled

and the adults gossiped until

the booming voice

of the jolly uncle could be

heard over the excited crowd.

"Everyone knows how this works,"

he shouted.  "I've hidden the family trophy.

We end today's search at the park next door.

Remember, the first one to find it

receives the cash prize

and bragging rights for a year.

Same rules as always!

Ready, set... Go!"

Joshua's heart fluttered in excitement.

The trophy was hidden

somewhere in the house.

Joshua sat on the couch and

took several minutes

to think about his strategy.

He wanted to escape the notice of

the others before he started his search.

He had a pretty good idea

where the treasure might be hidden.

Unfortunately, many of the adults

stayed behind and talked

since they hadn't seen

each other in awhile.

Joshua leaned back on the couch

and stared at the bookcase

across from him.

He saw the edge of the trophy

sticking out from behind

some volumes on the top shelf.

Trying to appear casual, he had to

wait over an hour for everyone to leave.

Finally, the room was clear!

Joshua searched the room

for something to stand on

so he could reach the top shelf.

Much later, he decided he must just

carefully climb up the tall bookcase.

He pulled the trophy from the top shelf.  

Joshua climbed down and

shouted his success.

The jolly relative rang a large bell

to signal the end of the treasure hunt.

Once everyone had gathered in the park,

he picked up the excited boy and,

holding him high,

pronounced Joshua the winner.

The family surrounded the boy

with their congratulations;

the younger ones helping Joshua

celebrate his new windfall.

Still laughing and talking,

the family sat at the picnic table

for the celebratory meal.
