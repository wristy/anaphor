Jessie was excited to hear the results

after her husband's participation

in yesterday's competition.

She knew that her husband grew

the sweetest apples anywhere.

The judges had already sampled them

at the state fair yesterday

and would meet with everyone today

to share the results.

Jessie entered the competition area.

She needed to find her husband

so that she could congratulate him

when the results were announed.

There were so many different displays.

Jessie felt overwhelmed by

the number of people present today.

She needed to find her husband.

She wanted to be able to support him

when the judges announced the results.

Jessie took out her cell phone

and called him.  When he picked up,

he told her to turn around.

When she did, she started laughing

as she saw that he was only

twenty steps away.

She joined her husband and helped him

prepare for the arrival of the judges.

First, she tried to talk

to her husband to calm him down.

A half hour later, she realized

that that wasn't working.

Then she took out a deck of cards and

suggested they play a game.

Her husband laughed

and they spent the next hour

playing any silly, mindless game

they could think of.

Finally, much later,

Jessie looked up to see the 

three judges approach.

Jessie was ecstatic when

her husband's sweet fruit was announced

as the grand prize winner.

She jumped up and down

in excitement as the oldest judge

handed her husband a blue ribbon!
