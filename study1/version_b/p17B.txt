It was late at night when Ryan,

a rookie cop, responded to the call.

He was eager to start the process

that could eventually lead to an arrest.

Ryan scanned the scene.

His eyes immediately landed on the

gleaming gun lying ominously

in the doorway.

He reached for his kit

for processing crime scenes.

Just then, he realized

that it was missing.

Ryan panicked for the next half hour,

wondering where it was.

There was no way

he could collect evidence without it.

His scatterbrained ways

would get him in trouble some day. 

Eventually, Ryan remembered

that he had left it in his car.

Since his car was parked close by,

in the driveway, he decided to relax.

His superiors would not arrive

for another hour or two.

Ryan sat on a couch and

flipped on the television.

An hour later, he finally rose

and walked outside.

He looked up at the stars

and started daydreaming

about the future.

He hoped he would

rapidly ascend through the ranks.

A half hour later, he roused himself

and climbed into his car.

It took him fifteen minutes

to finally locate the kit.  

Mentally, Ryan prepared himself for

the next steps he would take

in processing the scene.

He would start with analyzing

the gleaming weapon found at the house.

He would have to use the equipment

to dust for fingerprints.  Ryan knew

that if he worked methodically, his

thorough approach would produce results

that would help to apprehend the guilty.
