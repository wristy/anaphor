Jason and Jenna smiled at each other.

It was a wonderful date so far.

They climbed out of the vintage sailboat.

They were both hungry and eager

for their lunch reservation

after spending time on the water.

The restaurant was only

a few steps away,

right next to the dock.

Since it was such a beautiful day,

Jason and Jenna decided to sit

on the edge of the dock with their

feet in the water.

They soaked up the sun and

spent an hour reliving

the wonderful things they had

done so far.  Finally, Jason and Jenna

dried their feet and decided

to head to the restaurant.

The first time Jason and Jenna ate there,

they both agreed that they had never seen

such beautiful presentation

of the meals they ordered.

Moments later, they walked in the door.

The hostess informed them

that the wait was an hour.

They passed the time

in the waiting area,

planning future adventures.

An hour later, the hostess found them.

As they were shown to their table,

Jason asked Jenna which part of

their date she liked the best so far.

Jenna quickly said

that she really enjoyed her time in

the vintage vessel.  Then, Jason

and Jenna picked up the menu

and they prepared to order.
