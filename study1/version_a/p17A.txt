It was late at night when Ryan,

a rookie cop, responded to the call.

He was eager to start the process

that could eventually lead to an arrest.

Ryan scanned the scene.

His eyes immediately landed on the

gleaming gun lying ominously

in the doorway.

He reached for his kit

for processing crime scenes.

Just then, he realized that it was missing.

He needed to start remembering to arrive

with all his equipment.

His scatterbrained ways

would get him in trouble some day.

They had in the past.

Ryan let out a frustrated groan.

He panicked for a moment

and wondered where his kit could be.

There was no way he could collect

any evidence without it.  Then,

Ryan remembered that he had

left the kit in his car.  His superiors

hadn't arrived yet, so he sprinted

outside to the front yard.

It only took a minute.

Ryan's car was parked in the driveway.

Ryan whipped open the door

and climbed inside.  It only took him

a few seconds to locate the kit.

Ryan breathed a sigh of relief

when it was safely in his hand.

Mentally, Ryan prepared himself for

the next steps he would take

in processing the scene.

He would start with analyzing

the gleaming weapon found at the house.

He would have to use the equipment

to dust for fingerprints.  Ryan knew

that if he worked methodically, his

thorough approach would produce results

that would help to apprehend the guilty.
