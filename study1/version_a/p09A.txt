Sirens sounded in the distance.

The criminal knew

the authorities were closing in.

He used a rusty hammer to pry open

the old basement window.

He started to climb out of the window

but saw lights, so he retreated back

inside. He sprinted through the house.

The criminal burst through the front door.

He knew he was safe from the authorities

because the entrance was

completely hidden by tall hedges.

He paused for a moment, wondering what

he could do to evade the law.

Logic dictated that he stick to the shadows

and proceed at a slow and deliberate pace,

to avoid being discovered.

The criminal used his common sense

and did not run. He paused for a minute

to think about his options.

He needed to be smart

about what he did next.

His decision could mean the difference

between freedom and jail.  Seconds later,

his thinking was interrupted

by the sound of sirens.

He decided the safest move

was to stay where he was.  The criminal

retreated deeper into the hedges.

He hoped his hiding spot wouldn't be

discovered. The sirens passed moments later.

The criminal sprung from his hiding place

and raced to the house next door.

The moon was shining

brightly overhead as he paused 

to catch his breath and listen.

The criminal decided it was safe

to break into the house.

He struggled to open a side window.

The criminal wished he still had

the rusty tool to help him in his efforts.

After he got inside, he tiptoed around.

When he got to the kitchen

his heart sank when he saw two officers

waiting to apprehend him.
