Sarah could hardly believe

that her little sister

was turning thirteen tomorrow.

As usual, she had waited until the

last minute to purchase her present.

What would a new teenager want?

Sarah recalled what was at the top

of her wish list at that age: clothes.

She was going to find her sister

the perfect outfit.

Well, maybe not an entire outfit,

but Sarah would find her

a pair of trendy pants.

Sarah had only thirty minutes

before she had to be back home

for the birthday dinner.

This meant she really needed to rush! 

She was glad she had come to this store

to search for her sister's present.

It was a chic boutique that catered to

the tastes of the young

and the fashionable.

Her sister was very picky

and only a few items would fit her style.

Sarah surveyed the empty store.

It would only take a few minutes

to survey the inventory.  Unfortunately,

she didn't have the time

to look for anything for herself.

Her focus was completely on her sister.

Sarah examined the first rack.

Mere seconds later, she found it.

It was the perfect piece

of trendy clothing.  Sarah knew

her sister would love it.

She pushed aside hangers

in order to look for her sister's size.

She found the correct one

and walked to the register.

She smiled, anticipating the

pleased look on her sister's face.
