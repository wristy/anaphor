Jessie was excited to hear the results

after her husband's participation

in yesterday's competition.

She knew that her husband grew

the sweetest apples anywhere.

The judges had already sampled them

at the state fair yesterday

and would meet with everyone today

to share the results.

Jessie entered the competition area.

She needed to locate her husband at the

judge's table before the judges arrived.

There were so many different displays.

Jessie felt overwhelmed.

She didn't like navigating

through unfamiliar areas.

Hundreds of people moved

through countless brown tables

covered in hearty food.

If she didn't find her husband

at the judge's table soon,

she might miss her opportunity

to congratulate him when the judges

announced the results.  Additionally,

she knew how much her presence

would mean to him.

Jessie took out her cell phone

and called her husband.

Oddly enough, she heard a phone ringing

with her husband's unique ring tone

from somewhere close behind her.

Jessie turned around and laughed

when she saw that her husband

was only twenty steps away

from where she was standing.

Seconds later, Jessie arrived

at the judge's table.

She was just in time to see the

three judges approach.

Jessie was ecstatic when

her husband's sweet fruit was announced

as the grand prize winner.

She jumped up and down

in excitement as the oldest judge

handed her husband a blue ribbon!
