Jenna sat on the blue couch with a sigh.

She was here for the weekend doing a job

for Mr. and Mrs. Narayan.

Jenna hoped to earn enough

for her senior ski trip.

All she needed to do was to care for

their pets while they were

away for the weekend.

Jenna's first task was to pick up

the Narayan's friendly dog

from his vet appointment.

She walked outside

as small raindrops

started to fall.  Jenna didn't

want to get too wet.

She closed her umbrella

and hopped into her Toyota.

She would drive to the veterinary clinic,

which was just a couple blocks away.

Jenna backed the car down the driveway.

It momentarily crossed her mind

that the Narayans were lucky

to have an animal clinic so close by.

She had lost a pet once

because she couldn't get it

to the veterinarian quickly enough.

Jenna sped through

the beautiful neighborhood.

Minutes later, she pulled into

the parking lot of the veterinary clinic.

She had made it in record time:

five minutes!  She ran inside

and was happy to find there was no line.

She wrote her name on the list

and waited patiently.

The receptionist called her name

just a few minutes later.

Jenna hurriedly signed

the necessary papers

while the receptionist walked

into the back of the clinic.

Jenna smiled as she saw

the friendly animal come galloping

into the room.

Jenna took the leash

from the receptionist

and walked outside.
