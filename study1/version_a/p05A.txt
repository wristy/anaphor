The two girls had never been to the zoo.

This trip with their father, Jared,

would be the first.

The girls endlessly reminded their father

that they had to see the fierce lion

while they were there.

Jared reminded his girls

of the other animals that they could see

but the girls would not be

distracted from their goal.

Jared helped his girls examine

the zoo map at the entrance.

The girls giggled as they made it a race

to see who could find the exhibit first.

Seconds later,

the oldest daughter found it.

The exhibit was only a few yards away.

She grabbed her sister's hand

and pulled on Jared's coat.

The girls started running.

Jared tried to slow them down,

but finally gave in

to their eagerness with a laugh.

He ran after his excited girls.

A few minutes later,

he caught up with the girls.

They stood before the exhibit.

Jumping up and down in excitement,

the girls could finally see

the fierce animal in the distance.

After the girls had their fill

of looking at that exhibit,

they smiled with satisfaction.

The zoo had been a success.
