Keisha looked around

the bus stop with a sigh.

She couldn't believe her car

had broken down again.

She sat on a wooden bench

and pulled out her glossy paperback.

The bench cut into the backs of her legs

since she wasn't tall enough

for her feet to touch the ground.

She settled in to wait for the 8:57 bus.

Keisha was anxious for the bus to arrive.

Although she worked nearby,

her knees had been giving her trouble

and they made the short walk difficult.

Four minutes later,

the city bus rounded the corner.

Keisha stood up and grabbed her things.

She took a moment to stretch her legs.

As she stood, she realized that her knees

didn't feel too badly after all.

Keisha decided to walk

the block to her work.

She watched the bus pull away.

She was glad she had sat for

a few minutes on the bench.

It gave her knees a chance to loosen up.

Keisha stepped away from the bus stop

and briskly walked

the two blocks to her office.

She arrived at work five minutes later.

At that moment, she realized that she

had left her glossy book on the bench

at the bus stop.

She crossed her fingers that her car

would be fixed by that afternoon,

and she would be able to drive to work.
