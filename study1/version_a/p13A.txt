Delilah and Joseph were in the process

of moving from Chicago to London.

The biggest remaining task

was to pack their apartment.

The many smaller items had

already been packed. All that remained

were a couple of the bigger items.

They grabbed the wooden table in the

dining room and began to

dissemble it together.  Joseph searched

the remaining empty boxes

for one that was big enough.

Glancing at the clock,

Delilah realized that their friends

would be coming over to help them

in twenty minutes.

She looked over at the boxes

that Joseph was sorting through.

Panicking, she realized

that none were big enough.

Joseph saw his wife's distress.

He needed to find a solution

to the problem, and quick.

He grabbed the car keys and was about to

head out to buy a box.  Just then,

he remembered something

that could help their situation.

He had purchased a large packing box

yesterday that he hadn't put with the others.

It was just across the hall

in their storage locker.

Joseph stepped across the hall and quickly

located the target of his search.

As he picked it up, his stomach grumbled.

Unfortunately, there was no time to eat.

Their friends would be here any moment.

Joseph was about to head back

to help Delilah pack the pieces of

the wooden furniture when his phone rang.

It was Delilah calling to let him know

that the "reinforcements" had arrived.
