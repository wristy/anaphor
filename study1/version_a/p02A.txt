Everyone squeezed into the family room,

anxious to begin the treasure hunt,

an annual family tradition.

Joshua loved the party atmosphere

and could hardly wait

for the day's activities.

Children pushed and giggled

and the adults gossiped until

the booming voice

of the jolly uncle could be

heard over the excited crowd.

"Everyone knows how this works,"

he shouted.  "I've hidden the family trophy.

We end today's search at the park next door.

Remember, the first one to find it

receives the cash prize

and bragging rights for a year.

Same rules as always!

Ready, set... Go!"

Joshua's heart fluttered in excitement.

The trophy was hidden

somewhere in the house.

Joshua took a few seconds

to think about his strategy.

He loved challenges like these.  

He wanted to escape the notice of the

others before he started his search.

He had a pretty good idea

where the treasure might be hidden.

Luckily, the room cleared in a few minutes

as everyone raced to the

more obvious hiding areas:

the attic and the basement.

Joshua looked around to make sure that

no one was in the vicinity

of the family room, and then

he began his search right there.

Minutes later, he carefully climbed

the tall bookcase and

pulled the trophy from the top shelf

where it was hidden behind some volumes.

Joshua jumped down and shouted his success.

The jolly relative rang a large bell

to signal the end of the treasure hunt.

Once everyone had gathered in the park,

he picked up the excited boy and,

holding him high,

pronounced Joshua the winner.

The family surrounded the boy

with their congratulations;

the younger ones helping Joshua

celebrate his new windfall.

Still laughing and talking,

the family sat at the picnic table

for the celebratory meal.
