The aviation mechanic buried his head

in his work rag.  He attempted to

soak up some of the sweat

streaming down his face.

He had forgotten a few of his tools,

including the one he needed

for this repair.

He kicked the plastic chair.

He longed for the days

when he was part of a

line maintenance crew,

making the simple checks and adjustments

necessary before take-offs.

He quickly realized

that he didn't have time

to vent his frustration

even though he wanted to.

He was up against a deadline

just like he always was.

He looked around the hangar.

The mechanic took a second to

moan over the time he would lose

looking for his tool.

Then he sprang into action.

He was about to run to his car

when he tripped over his toolbox.

He was thankful that he wouldn't have to

run out to his car after all.

He bent down to rummage

through its contents.

It took him only a few seconds

to locate the forgotten tool.

Rising to his feet,

he thought about his problem

controlling his temper.

He felt foolish for kicking

the plastic furniture earlier,

when he was frustrated.

Experience had told him

that simple mistakes

were nothing to get upset about.

Problems usually

resolved themselves in the end.
