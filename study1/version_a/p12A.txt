Jason and Jenna smiled at each other.

It was a wonderful date so far.

They climbed out of the vintage sailboat.

They were both hungry and eager

for their lunch reservation

after spending time on the water.

The restaurant was only a few steps away,

right next to the dock.  This restaurant

was always busy

because it boasted beautiful views

from practically any table.

It also had a reputation

for culinary creativity and expertise.

The first time Jason and Jenna ate there,

they both agreed that they had never

seen such beautiful presentation

of the meals they ordered.

They were looking forward to

a similar experience today.  

Jason and Jenna hustled up the dock

because they did not want

to lose their reservation.

They had to make this reservation

almost three weeks in advance

in order to have a window seat

during the lunch rush.  Jason and Jenna

arrived at the restaurant

five minutes later.

They had made it on time.

As they were shown to their table,

Jason asked Jenna which part of

their date she liked the best so far.

Jenna quickly said

that she really enjoyed her time in

the vintage vessel.  Then, Jason

and Jenna picked up the menu

and they prepared to order.
