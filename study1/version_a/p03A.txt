Wiping his brow with the kitchen towel,

the chef paused for a moment

in his preparations to survey the mess

he had created.

This meal had to be perfect,

flawless from the appetizers

to the dessert.

Not wanting to waste time,

he picked up the gleaming knife

and continued to cut

the vegetables for the salad.

The timer sounded, signaling that it was

time to apply the herb rub to the roast.

Where did he put those spices?

How could he have forgotten

something like that

on such an important day?

He must have left them in his catering van.

Discouraged, the chef couldn't believe

that he wasn't prepared for this.

Some of the city's most important people

would be attending this dinner.

To forget something as important as

his spices for the roast

was the equivalent of professional suicide.

The chef only allowed these worries

to occupy his mind for a few minutes.

Then, jumping up, he ran through the kitchen

and out into the rented hall.

The tables were beautiful

with their floral centerpieces

and decadent desserts.

Miraculously, he saw his box of spices

sitting on the first table!

He must have set it down

on his way into the kitchen.

The chef straightened his shoulders

and reclaimed his confidence.

He could envision how everything would go.

He would first combine the spices in a bowl.

Then, he would slide the seasoned roast

back into the oven.  Finally, he would use

his gleaming utensil to complete

the preparations.

If tonight was successful,

he could look forward to an

exciting career in the catering business.
