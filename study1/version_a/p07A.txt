Jason looked around

his high school gymnasium.

It was overwhelmed by the

large number of booths,

each representing a different career.

He wanted to pursue a career

in the field of education

as a motivating teacher, so locating that

information table was his top priority.

Jason was grateful for

the opportunity to learn more

about a variety of jobs.

His class requirement was to distribute

a minimum of three resumes

and participate in interviews today.

Many of his classmates today

were frustrated with this requirement.

Jason, however, was actually looking

forward to doing some research

about possible career paths.

He started to walk across the gym.

He hoped he remembered

to bring his paperwork.  In particular,

he needed his resumes

so that he could distribute them.

Jason had spent

a tremendous amount of time

collecting the requisite information,

and formatting it in an appealing way.

He was going to be in big trouble

if he didn't have them.

Jason felt panic for

the briefest of moments.  However,

he quickly regained his composure.

He was usually responsible

and thorough when it came to such details.

He reached his hand into his bag

and began rummaging around.

Seconds later, he 

found his stack of resumes

under the papers.

Jason was relieved he had

the necessary paperwork to start looking

into the motivating career he was

interested in. 

He stuffed the stack of resumes

in his bag.
