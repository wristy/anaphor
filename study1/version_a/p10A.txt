Following the doctor's visit,

The tension in the hospital room

was palpable.  All the parents

could hear was the echo of the doctor's

diagnosis: their daughter was battling

an aggressive cancer.  There was so

much sadness here.  Of course,

it could have been worse.

The parents were eager to do something

to cheer up their daughter.

They decided to find something that

would make her smile when she woke up.

The father remembered the gift store

that he and his wife had seen.

The father decided to buy their daughter

a new teddy bear.

His wife asked him to hurry.

This was easy to do since the gift store

was just down the hall from

their daughter's room.  Seconds later,

the father started sprinting

through the 7th floor of the hospital.

After a few strides, he saw

his neighbors walking down the hall.

They had come to visit his daughter.

They had brought colorful balloons,

but the father pushed past the group.

He raced to the gift store.

He was the only customer in the store

so the purchase was quick. 

Just a few minutes after arriving,

he exited the store.

He was physically tired from his hurrying.

He was also emotionally drained.

He tucked the teddy bear under his arm

and took a deep breath.

He knew they could be strong

as they fought this 

aggressive disease as a family.

Together, they would

make it through this.
