The music instructor looked outside.

The snow that was falling

beyond her window was dense and wet.

Running her fingers lovingly

over the shabby piano, she sighed.

She prepared for the day.

She was already cold so she

wrapped another sweater

around her thin shoulders.

The day's lessons were about to start.

Students traveled to her home every day.

The music instructor liked this arrangement.

It was convenient because

she didn't have to leave her home.

All she had to do was to

wait for the students to arrive.

The music instructor waited for

only two minutes when her phone rang.

It was her first student calling to cancel.

The instructor settled in

to wait for the second student.

But only one minute later,

her phone rang again.

It was that student,

also calling to cancel!

The music instructor had barely

hung up her cell when she heard from

the third and final student of the day.

He was also calling to cancel his lesson.

The instructor suddenly had

no lessons to teach for the day.

Only a few minutes had passed.

The music instructor

hadn't even left her chair.  Getting up,

she walked to the front door

to retrieve the day's mail.

She looked forward

to spending the afternoon in the 

warmth of her home, her fingers dancing

over the shabby instrument she loved.

She couldn't wait to ease

into a familiar aria,

letting her eyes drift closed

so she could completely enjoy

the music as she played.

She hoped that someday

one of her students would find

the release and comfort that she did

when she sat down on the bench.
