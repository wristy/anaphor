A soft breeze swirled

Tamika's skirt around her ankles.

The only sound in the cemetery

was the whispering leaves.

Tamika wiped a tear from her cheek

as she stood by her mother's grave.

Her mother's favorite flowers

were yellow roses. Tamika placed

a bouquet of them on the grave.

She hurried out of the cemetery.

She did not want to be in that place

any longer than necessary.

Some people like to linger

in the places where their loved ones rest,

but this was not Tamika's preference.

Her visit to her mother's grave was over.

As usual, she was overwhelmed

by emotions and memories.  Besides,

she was meeting her friend for lunch

in the cafe across the street.

Tamika was very hungry

and was glad their meeting

was in only five minutes.

Looking briefly in both directions,

Tamika dashed across the street.

Seconds later, she stepped from the cold

into the warmth of the cafe.

There were plenty of open tables.

Tamika chose the one closest to the door.

Even though it had been a difficult visit,

Tamika was happy that she had put

the yellow flowers on her mother's grave.

She was sure that her mother

would enjoy looking down

on those beautiful blooms

dancing in the breeze.
