The woman huddled on the floor.  She

watched the three men shatter the glass

jewelry case with the butts of their guns.

The men scooped the glitzy diamonds

into black velvet bags.

The woman was close to the door that

the robbers had carelessly left open.

Although scared, she decided to escape

and to try to find help.  

The woman grabbed her purse

and quickly slid across the floor.

She launched herself through the doorway.

Seconds later, she jumped to her feet

And scampered around to the

side of the building.  She decided

she'd be safe hiding there in the shadows.

The woman spent a brief minute

trying to calm her racing heart.

She had to find a way to get help!

She couldn't help but think of all those

other customers in the jewelry store.

They were helpless unless

she could contact the authorities.

At that moment, she remembered

the cell phone in her pocket.

Feeling stupid, she retrieved the phone,

flipped it open, and hurriedly dialed 911.

Seconds later, she told the operator

that a robbery was taking place.

When asked for the address,

she replied that she didn't know. 

She also mentioned that thieves were

grabbing the glitzy gems.  The woman

closed her cell phone, exhausted.

She breathed a sigh of relief,

thankful that she had been able to escape

and call for help.
