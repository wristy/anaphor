Sophia straightened her suit,

took a deep breath,

and entered the hotel's bar,

just off the lobby.  She took a seat

at an empty high-top table.

She ordered an amber beer,

hoping to calm her nerves.

The waitress set Sophia's drink 

on the table and moved on.

Before Sophia could even take a sip,

her cell phone rang.

It was the client

calling to confirm their meeting

in the lobby of the Madison Hotel.

Sophia checked her watch

and confirmed that their meeting

would begin in ten minutes.

She hung up her phone

and took a deep breath.

Sophia was not looking forward to

meeting with this client.

He had been very temperamental and

borderline rude the last time they met.

His arrogant attitude

always put her on edge.

Over the next few minutes,

Sophia made room on the table

for some papers and dumped the contents

of her briefcase in front of her.

She nervously sorted through

the documents.

Five minutes later, Sophia realized

she wouldn't be able to concentrate.

She hurried out of the bar,

back into the hotel lobby.

Sophia quickened her pace

when she noticed the client

already sitting in a chair, waiting.

He rose from his chair

and instantly launched into a list

of his complaints.

Sophia pasted a smile on her face

and found herself wishing

for the amber beverage she left

back in the bar.  

She mentally prepared herself for 

what was sure to be a difficult meeting.
