Everyone squeezed into the family room,

anxious to begin the treasure hunt,

an annual family tradition.

Joshua loved the party atmosphere

and could hardly wait

for the day's activities.

Children pushed and giggled

and the adults gossiped until

the booming voice

of the jolly uncle could be

heard over the excited crowd.

"Everyone knows how this works,"

he shouted.  "I've hidden the family trophy.

We end today's search at the park next door.

Remember, the first one to find it

receives the cash prize

and bragging rights for a year.

Same rules as always!

Ready, set... Go!"

Joshua's heart fluttered in excitement.

The trophy was hidden somewhere

in the neighborhood.

Joshua needed a method in order to

find the treasure first.

He wanted to be sure that

he wouldn't be followed.

After a few minutes,

he was able to begin.

Leaving the house, he sprinted

down several blocks.

Joshua skidded around a corner,

crouching behind a rock briefly when

he spotted some cousins in the distance.

He ran past several houses

to arrive at the yard with the hollow tree.

Climbing the fence,

he tore his pants in his haste.

Joshua tumbled to the other side

and rushed to the tree.

Moments later, he was standing

on his tiptoes, peering inside.

He found the hidden treasure!

There was no time to

celebrate his victory.

Joshua grabbed the family trophy

and sprinted to the park

three blocks away,

shouting his success.

The jolly relative rang a large bell

to signal the end of the treasure hunt.

Once everyone had gathered in the park,

he picked up the excited boy and,

holding him high,

pronounced Joshua the winner.

The family surrounded the boy

with their congratulations;

the younger ones helping Joshua

celebrate his new windfall.

Still laughing and talking,

the family sat at the picnic table

for the celebratory meal.
