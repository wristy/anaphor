The warrior sprung from his

afternoon nap, ready for the battle

that was a half hour away.    

He threw on his wool shirt,

bothered not at all by its

tattered condition or egregious smell.

Many thoughts raced through his mind.

He had fought many battles in his life,

and had come close to dying several times.

Today's battle was just a game, however;

a competition to determine

the best man in the land.  He had fought

many men over the years,

many stronger than him.  He had vanquished

them all because combat is not about 

deploying one's strengths.  Rather,

it is about exploiting your opponent's

weaknesses.  These thoughts flowed

through his mind.

The warrior was hungry for a quick meal.

He raced through the village 

in search of his favorite inn.

The warrior sat down to a bit of ale 

and an old drumstick.

This was his traditional meal before battle.

He had actually come to hate drumsticks,

but was far too superstitious to change

his menu at this point in his life.

He rapidly devoured the few morsels

for the energy they provided.

He finished the meal in a matter of minutes.

He then continued his journey.

A few minutes later,

he stopped beside a peaceful brook.  

The warrior sank his hands into the water.

He then wiped his soiled fingers

on his wool clothing.  Finally,

he changed into his armor

and prepared himself for battle.
