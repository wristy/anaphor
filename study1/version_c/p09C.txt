Sirens sounded in the distance.

The criminal knew

the authorities were closing in.

He used a rusty hammer to pry open

the old basement window.

He started to climb out of the window

but saw lights, so he retreated back

inside. He sprinted through the house.

The criminal burst through the front door.

He knew he was safe from the authorities

because the entrance was

completely hidden by tall hedges.

He paused for a moment, wondering what

he could do to evade the law.

Logic dictated that he stick to the shadows

and proceed at a slow and deliberate pace,

to avoid being discovered.

But the criminal disregarded

all common sense and started running.

It was the only option.

He ran for ten minutes,

coming to a wooded area one mile away.

The criminal didn't even

break his stride as he dodged

through the trees.  He ran

for ten more minutes, to a park

another mile away.  Suddenly,

he heard sirens.  He ducked inside

a tube slide to hide.  The criminal

held his breath,

hoping that his hiding spot

wouldn't be discovered.

When the sirens passed,

he left his hiding place behind.

He searched the neighborhood

for a few minutes until he found

a seemingly abandoned house.

The moon was shining

brightly overhead as he paused 

to catch his breath and listen.

The criminal decided it was safe

to break into the house.

He struggled to open a side window.

The criminal wished he still had

the rusty tool to help him in his efforts.

After he got inside, he tiptoed around.

When he got to the kitchen

his heart sank when he saw two officers

waiting to apprehend him.
