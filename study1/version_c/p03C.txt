Wiping his brow with the kitchen towel,

the chef paused for a moment

in his preparations to survey the mess

he had created.

This meal had to be perfect,

flawless from the appetizers

to the dessert.

Not wanting to waste time,

he picked up the gleaming knife

and continued to cut

the vegetables for the salad.

The timer sounded, signaling that it was

time to apply the herb rub to the roast.

Where did he put those spices?

How could he have forgotten

something like that

on such an important day?

He must have left them in his catering van.

The chef ran through the kitchen

and between dozens of tables.

In a matter of seconds,

he raced through the rented hall

until he reached the exit.

Bursting out of the double doors,

he sprinted past a florist and

a pastry shop, and

up San Francisco's steepest hill.

His van was parked at the very top.

After five minutes of running,

the chef was becoming very tired.

At that moment,

he looked to his left

and noticed a trolley approaching.

The chef grabbed a pole

and jumped on the trolley.

This mode of transportation

allowed him to cover

the remaining mile

in a matter of minutes.

Moments later,

the chef hopped off the trolley

and sprinted to his van.

The chef grabbed the forgotten

box of spices and

breathed a sigh of relief.

Catching his breath

and reclaiming his confidence,

he could envision

how everything would go.  

He would first combine the spices in a bowl.

Then, he would slide the seasoned roast

back into the oven.  Finally, he would use

his gleaming utensil to complete

the preparations.

If tonight was successful,

he could look forward to an

exciting career in the catering business.
