Jason looked around

his high school gymnasium.

It was overwhelmed by the

large number of booths,

each representing a different career.

He wanted to pursue a career

in the field of education

as a motivating teacher, so locating that

information table was his top priority.

Jason was grateful for

the opportunity to learn more

about a variety of jobs.

His class requirement was to distribute

a minimum of three resumes

and participate in interviews today.

Jason opened his bag

to remove his resumes.

He was irritated to realize that

he had forgotten them at home.

Unfortunately, his home

was several miles away.

Jason was frustrated, but at least he had

driven to the school rather than walked.

He sprinted out of the gymnasium

and jumped in his car.  Seconds later,

he was speeding through town.

Five minutes later, he came to

a fork in the road.

He decided to cut through the city park.

This enabled him to

avoid the traffic downtown.

He emerged on the other side of the park

a few minutes later.

Next, he came to the high school

and its athletic fields.

He sped past them in less than a minute.

Jason screeched to a halt

in front of his house and ran inside.

On one side of the coffee table

was a stack of newspapers.  He 

found his stack of resumes

under the papers.

Jason was relieved he had

the necessary paperwork to start looking

into the motivating career he was

interested in. 

He stuffed the stack of resumes

in his bag.
