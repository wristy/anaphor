Sarah could hardly believe

that her little sister

was turning thirteen tomorrow.

As usual, she had waited until the

last minute to purchase her present.

What would a new teenager want?

Sarah recalled what was at the top

of her wish list at that age: clothes.

She was going to find her sister

the perfect outfit.

Well, maybe not an entire outfit,

but Sarah would find her

a pair of trendy pants.

Sarah had only thirty minutes

before she had to be back home

for the birthday dinner.

She ran to her car.

She flew out of the driveway

and sped into town.  Five minutes later,

Sarah arrived at the mall.

She knew there was a chic boutique there.

She pushed her way inside.

Five minutes later, she hadn't seen

anything her sister would like.

She jumped back in her car and sped off.

On the left, Sarah passed the hair salon. 

Remembering that she was out of shampoo,

she ducked in and bought a bottle.

She then continued on her journey.

She flew into the parking lot

of the outlet store and ran inside.

She found what she was

looking for immediately.

It was the perfect piece

of trendy clothing.  Sarah knew

her sister would love it.

She pushed aside hangers

in order to look for her sister's size.

She found the correct one

and walked to the register.

She smiled, anticipating the

pleased look on her sister's face.
