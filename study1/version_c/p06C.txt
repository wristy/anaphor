The aviation mechanic buried his head

in his work rag.  He attempted to

soak up some of the sweat

streaming down his face.

He had forgotten a few of his tools,

including the one he needed

for this repair.

He kicked the plastic chair.

He longed for the days

when he was part of a

line maintenance crew,

making the simple checks and adjustments

necessary before take-offs.

There was no time

to vent his frustration

because he was up against a deadline.

He raced out of the hangar.

Seconds later, the mechanic started

sprinting toward his car

in the remote parking lot.

That's where he kept his toolbox.

He ran past the control tower.

He didn't even have time

to wave at his friend Sam.

A few minutes later,

he passed by the main office.

Unfortunately, there was no time

to pick up his check.

He continued past the terminal,

dodging travelers. He jogged to his car

on the far side of the parking lot.

The mechanic spilled

the contents of his toolbox

and quickly located the forgotten tool.

Tired and hot,

he thought about his problem

controlling his temper.

He felt foolish for kicking

the plastic furniture earlier,

when he was frustrated.

Experience had told him

that simple mistakes

were nothing to get upset about.

Problems usually

resolved themselves in the end.
