Delilah and Joseph were in the process

of moving from Chicago to London.

The biggest remaining task

was to pack their apartment.

The many smaller items had

already been packed. All that remained

were a couple of the bigger items.

They grabbed the wooden table in the

dining room and began to

dissemble it together.  Joseph searched

the remaining empty boxes

for one that was big enough.

Glancing at the clock,

Delilah realized that their friends

would be coming over to help them

in twenty minutes.  She looked over at

the boxes that Joseph was sorting through.

Panicking, she realized that none were big.

Joseph grabbed the car keys

and headed to the parking lot.

He was going to buy a large box

at the shipping store across town.

He jumped in their car and

raced across town.  After two miles,

he passed a post office.

That reminded him of

another task on their list.

He ran inside and grabbed a

change-of-address form

to fill out later.

A few miles later, he drove by the bank.

He remembered that he needed

to get money to pay the movers.

He drove through the ATM and withdrew

the maximum amount.  Minutes later,

he pulled back onto the road

and sped to the shipping store.

Joseph screeched to a halt

in the parking lot.

He grabbed their largest packing box,

threw his cash at the clerk,

and jumped back into the car.

Joseph was about to head back

to help Delilah pack the pieces of

the wooden furniture when his phone rang.

It was Delilah calling to let him know

that the "reinforcements" had arrived.
