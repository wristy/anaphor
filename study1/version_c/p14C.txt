Jenna sat on the blue couch with a sigh.

She was here for the weekend doing a job

for Mr. and Mrs. Narayan.

Jenna hoped to earn enough

for her senior ski trip.

All she needed to do was to care for

their pets while they were

away for the weekend.

Jenna's first task was to pick up

the Narayan's friendly dog

from his vet appointment.

She walked outside

as small raindrops

started to fall.  Jenna didn't

want to get too wet.

She closed her umbrella

and hopped into her Toyota.

She would drive to the veterinary clinic,

which was all the way across town.

She headed off.

Five minutes and one mile later,

Jenna sped past the bakery.

She wished she could stop.

Usually, when running errands,

she would take a few moments

to treat herself.

Another five minutes

and another mile later,

she flew past a pet store

that was having a huge sale.

Unfortunately, Jenna didn't have time

to look inside and purchase treats

for the Narayan's animals.  Instead,

she continued her trip to the vet.

Jenna covered the last few miles

in ten short minutes.

She screeched into the parking lot

of the veterinary clinic and ran inside.

She was happy to find there was no line.

Jenna hurriedly signed

the necessary papers

while the receptionist walked

into the back of the clinic.

Jenna smiled as she saw

the friendly animal come galloping

into the room.

Jenna took the leash

from the receptionist

and walked outside.
