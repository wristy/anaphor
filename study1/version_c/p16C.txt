Keisha looked around

the bus stop with a sigh.

She couldn't believe her car

had broken down again.

She sat on a wooden bench

and pulled out her glossy paperback.

The bench cut into the backs of her legs

since she wasn't tall enough

for her feet to touch the ground.

She settled in to wait for the 8:57 bus.

Keisha was anxious for a bus to arrive.

Four minutes later,

it rounded the corner.

Keisha grabbed her things

and boarded the bus.

She took a seat near the front.

She gazed out the window as the bus

started to speed

the several miles to her work.

After two minutes,

the bus passed her favorite bakery.

They sold delicious pastries there.

A few minutes later,

the bus sped past the bus stop

in front of the grocery store.

It didn't stop because there were no

people waiting at that bus stop.

Instead, it continued

along its speedy journey.

One mile later,

the bus gave a violent jolt.

Fearing they'd have

mechanical difficulties, Keisha was

relieved when the bus

shuddered back to normal.

She was now only

five miles from her building.

The bus continued to make great time.

Five minutes later, it arrived

at the stop in front of her work.

At that moment, she realized that she

had left her glossy book on the bench

at the bus stop.

She crossed her fingers that her car

would be fixed by that afternoon,

and she would be able to drive to work.
