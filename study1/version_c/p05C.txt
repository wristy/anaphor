The two girls had never been to the zoo.

This trip with their father, Jared,

would be the first.

The girls endlessly reminded their father

that they had to see the fierce lion

while they were there.

Jared reminded his girls

of the other animals that they could see

but the girls would not be

distracted from their goal.

They rushed around their house

as they tried to get ready to go.

After five minutes

of brushing teeth and combing hair,

the family was ready.

Traffic was light.

The family's minivan covered the five

miles to the zoo in just ten minutes.

The trip was punctuated

by the excited chatter of the girls.

They were happy to be spending

the day with their father.

He sped through the parking lot

and pulled into a parking spot

right next to the zoo's main entrance.

Jared grabbed his girls by their hands

and they raced to the exhibit.

Jumping up and down in excitement,

the girls could finally see

the fierce animal in the distance.

After the girls had their fill

of looking at that exhibit,

they smiled with satisfaction.

The zoo had been a success.
