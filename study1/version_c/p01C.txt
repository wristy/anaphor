Sophia straightened her suit,

took a deep breath,

and entered the hotel's bar,

just off the lobby.  She took a seat

at an empty high-top table.

She ordered an amber beer,

hoping to calm her nerves.

The waitress set Sophia's drink 

on the table and moved on.

Before Sophia could even take a sip,

her cell phone rang.

It was the client

calling to confirm their meeting

in the lobby of the Madison Hotel.

The Madison Hotel?

Sophia was sitting

in the wrong hotel.

The Madison was

several miles away!

Sophia maintained her composure

and assured the client

that their meeting together

would begin in ten minutes.

She hung up her phone,

grabbed her bag,

and raced out of the hotel.

It was raining heavily outside.

Sophia stopped at

the drugstore down the block

to buy an umbrella.

She quickly completed

her purchase and hustled

out of the store.

She suddenly realized

she would never

make it in time on foot,

so she hailed a cab.

It was a good decision:

She arrived at the Madison hotel

ten minutes later.

She was all wet,

and dashed into the restroom

to freshen up.

After a few minutes, 

she looked much better. 

She hurried through the lobby 

where she saw the client 

impatiently waiting.  

He rose from his chair

and instantly launched into a list

of his complaints.

Sophia pasted a smile on her face

and found herself wishing

for the amber beverage she left

back in the bar.

She mentally prepared herself for 

what was sure to be a difficult meeting.
