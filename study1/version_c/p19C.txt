The woman huddled on the floor.  She

watched the three men shatter the glass

jewelry case with the butts of their guns.

The men scooped the glitzy diamonds

into black velvet bags.

The woman was close to the door that

the robbers had carelessly left open.

Although scared, she decided to escape

and to try to find help.  

The woman grabbed her purse and

quickly slid across the floor.

She launched herself through the doorway.

She jumped to her feet

and sprinted a mile down the street.

Ten minutes later, she came to a bank.

She tried to find help,

but it was closed.

She continued running down the road. 

Not finding anyone,

she cut across a construction site.

She jumped over stacks of lumber

and pallets of shingles.

A few minutes later, and out of breath,

she came to a payphone.

It was out of order.

She had to find a way to get help!

She couldn't help but think

of all those other customers

in the jewelry store.

They were helpless unless she could

contact the authorities.  At that moment,

she remembered the cell phone

in her pocket.  Feeling stupid,

she retrieved it and hurriedly dialed 911.

Seconds later, she urgently told

the operator that a robbery

was taking place.  She also

mentioned that thieves were grabbing

the glitzy gems.  The woman

closed her cell phone, exhausted.

She breathed a sigh of relief,

thankful that she'd been able to escape

and call for help.
