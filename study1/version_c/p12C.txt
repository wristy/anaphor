Jason and Jenna smiled at each other.

It was a wonderful date so far.

They climbed out of the vintage sailboat.

They were both hungry and eager

for their lunch reservation

after spending time on the water.

Their reservation was in ten minutes

and the restaurant was

several miles away.  Jason and Jenna

jumped in his convertible

and raced through the town.

The wind whipped Jenna's hair

around her face as Jason disregarded

all posted speed limits. 

Along the way,

they stopped by the drug store.

They both needed aloe for their sunburn.

There was no time to put it on

now, though.  Just then, Jenna

remembered that the restaurant

did not have a liquor license.

They ran across the street and

popped into a wine store.

There was a large display in front

and they grabbed a bottle and

paid for it in no time at all.

A few minutes later, the convertible

screeched into the parking lot

of the restaurant.  Jason and Jenna

grabbed their wine and rushed inside.

As they were shown to their table,

Jason asked Jenna which part of

their date she liked the best so far.

Jenna quickly said

that she really enjoyed her time in

the vintage vessel.  Then, Jason

and Jenna picked up the menu

and they prepared to order.
