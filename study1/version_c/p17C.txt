It was late at night when Ryan,

a rookie cop, responded to the call.

He was eager to start the process

that could eventually lead to an arrest.

Ryan scanned the scene.

His eyes immediately landed on the

gleaming gun lying ominously

in the doorway.

He reached for his kit

for processing crime scenes.

Just then, he remembered that he

had left his kit for processing

crime scenes at home.

His scatterbrained ways

would get him in trouble some day. 

Ryan's superiors hadn't arrived yet,

so he sprinted to his car

in less than a minute.

He climbed in and turned on

the flashing lights so that he could

speed through the neighborhood.

After five minutes,

he sped past a gas station.

He was low on gas, so he stopped

just long enough to pump a few gallons.

A mile later he flew past

a 24-hour grocery store.

Although he really didn't have time,

he stopped to quickly buy

a pack of cigarettes.

He covered the two remaining

miles to his house

in just a few minutes.

When he arrived, he raced inside,

grabbed his kit,

and ran back to his car.  

Mentally, Ryan prepared himself for

the next steps he would take

in processing the scene.

He would start with analyzing

the gleaming weapon found at the house.

He would have to use the equipment

to dust for fingerprints.  Ryan knew

that if he worked methodically, his

thorough approach would produce results

that would help to apprehend the guilty.
