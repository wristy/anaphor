Following the doctor's visit,

The tension in the hospital room

was palpable.  All the parents

could hear was the echo of the doctor's

diagnosis: their daughter was battling

an aggressive cancer.  There was so

much sadness here.  Of course,

it could have been worse.

The parents were eager to do something

to cheer up their daughter.

They decided to find something that

would make her smile when she woke up.

The father remembered the gift store

that he and his wife had seen.

The father decided to buy their daughter

a new teddy bear.

His wife asked him to hurry.

This would be difficult because

the gift store was several blocks away.

The father sprinted through

the 7th floor of the hospital.

He didn't have time

to wait for the elevator,

so he ran down the stairs in record time.

Seconds later, he was in the lobby.

He saw his neighbors

holding colorful balloons

for his daughter,

but he pushed past them

and sprinted out of the hospital.

The father covered the several blocks

to the gift store in no time at all.

Thoughts of his daughter

raced through his mind.

He was the only customer in the store

so the purchase was quick.

Just a few minutes after arriving,

he exited the store.

He was physically tired

from his hurrying and emotionally drained.

He tucked the teddy bear

under his arm and took a deep breath.

He knew they could be strong

as they fought this 

aggressive disease as a family.

Together, they would

make it through this.
