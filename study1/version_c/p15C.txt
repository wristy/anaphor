Jessie was excited to hear the results

after her husband's participation

in yesterday's competition.

She knew that her husband grew

the sweetest apples anywhere.

The judges had already sampled them

at the state fair yesterday

and would meet with everyone today

to share the results.

Jessie entered the competition area.

She needed to locate her husband at the

judge's table before the judges arrived.

Jessie took out her cell phone 

and called her husband.

She hoped he could give her clear

directions to his location.

After a brief and tense conversation,

she realized that she was on

the wrong side of the vast fair!

Jessie sprinted back to the parking lot.

Five minutes later, she was speeding

through the outskirts of the fair.

She passed a lemonade stand

and paused for two minutes

to buy a cool drink.  She gulped it down

as she drove off.  Jessie arrived

at the correct side of the fairgrounds

ten minutes later.

She frantically pushed her way through

countless brown tables

covered in hearty food.

She paused only for a moment

to use the restroom.  There was no line,

and she knew they'd be busy later.

Breathless, she joined her husband

at the judge's table

just in time to see the 

three judges approach.

Jessie was ecstatic when

her husband's sweet fruit was announced

as the grand prize winner.

She jumped up and down

in excitement as the oldest judge

handed her husband a blue ribbon!
