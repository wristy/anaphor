The music instructor looked outside.

The snow that was falling

beyond her window was dense and wet.

Running her fingers lovingly

over the shabby piano, she sighed.

She prepared for the day.

She was already cold when she

struggled into her coat.

The music instructor traveled

several miles each day so she could

give students lessons in their homes.

She put her cell phone in her pocket

and set out into the cold.

Jumping into her car, she drove

as quickly as the weather allowed

to her first student, Anya.

As the music instructor pulled into

the driveway, the phone rang.

Anya was calling to cancel,

explaining that she hadn't practiced

the past week.  The music instructor

backed out of the driveway.

A few minutes and a few miles later,

she arrived at Amy's house.

When Amy opened the door,

she was still wearing her pajamas.

She was sick and had forgotten

to call to cancel her lesson.

Frustrated, the music instructor

jumped back in her car.

She had barely left Amy's street

when her phone rang.  It was Jose,

calling to reschedule his lesson.

The day had been a complete failure.

She turned the car around

and started heading home,

just a few minutes after

she had started her trip.

She looked forward to spending

the afternoon back inside the

warmth of her home, her fingers dancing

over the shabby instrument she loved.

She couldn't wait to ease

into a familiar aria,

letting her eyes drift closed

so she could completely enjoy

the music as she played.

She hoped that someday

one of her students would find

the release and comfort that she did

when she sat down on the bench.
