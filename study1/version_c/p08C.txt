A soft breeze swirled

Tamika's skirt around her ankles.

The only sound in the cemetery

was the whispering leaves.

Tamika wiped a tear from her cheek

as she stood by her mother's grave.

Her mother's favorite flowers

were yellow roses. Tamika placed

a bouquet of them on the grave.

Her pace quickened

as she crossed the street

and sprinted to her car.

She didn't enjoy returning

to her hometown, and wanted to

leave as soon as possible. Besides,

she was meeting her friend for lunch

in the neighboring town.

Tamika flew through her hometown

in a matter of minutes.

At the outskirts, she whipped

through a drive through

and grabbed a coffee.

Tamika ignored the posted speed limits

as she continued on her way.

The next town was ten minutes away,

and she wanted to get there

as soon as possible.  Minutes later,

Tamika screeched into the parking lot.

She dashed from the coolness outside

to the warmth of the cafe.

There were plenty of open tables.

Tamika chose the one closest to the door.

Even though it had been a difficult visit,

Tamika was happy that she had put

the yellow flowers on her mother's grave.

She was sure that her mother

would enjoy looking down

on those beautiful blooms

dancing in the breeze.
