Mia stepped into the small deli located in a bustling neighborhood, excited for the day ahead. She ordered a chilled wrap, and the friendly server promptly prepared it with care.
Just as she was about to enjoy it, her phone buzzed: her train, departing from a station several blocks away on the edge of town, was scheduled to leave in five minutes.
Mia grabbed her bag and hurried across busy streets. When she finally arrived at the distant station, she couldnâ€™t help but miss the chilled item waiting at the deli.
