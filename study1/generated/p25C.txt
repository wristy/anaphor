Rafael strolled into the neighborhood cafe on a scorching day and ordered an icy lemonade, hoping it would cool him down. The barista handed him the tall glass with a friendly smile. Before Rafael could take a sip, his phone beeped with a reminder for a meeting in the adjoining roomâ€”scheduled to begin in two hours. Taking advantage of the extra time, he lingered for a few moments before making his way next door. Once inside, he longed for that icy beverage.
