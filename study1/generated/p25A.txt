Rafael strolled into the neighborhood cafe on a scorching day and ordered an icy lemonade, hoping it would cool him down. The barista handed him the tall glass with a friendly smile. Before Rafael could take a sip, his phone beeped with a reminder for a meeting in the cafe’s adjacent meeting room—starting in five minutes. He quickly left the counter and stepped into the nearby room. Once seated, he found himself longing for that icy beverage.
