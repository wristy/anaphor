Mia stepped into the small deli located in a busy part of town, excited for the day ahead. She ordered a chilled wrap, and the friendly server promptly prepared it with care.
Before she could taste it, her phone buzzed with news: her train, departing from a station several miles away, had been delayed by an hour.
Taking her time to relax, Mia eventually set out on a long walk through crowded streets. When she finally reached the remote station, she couldn’t help but long for the chilled item she’d left at the deli.
