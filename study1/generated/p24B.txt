Marcus walked into the trendy diner on the corner and ordered a sparkling soda, expecting its effervescence to perk him up. The waiter promptly delivered the chilled drink.

He hurriedly left the diner and flagged a cab to cover the distance. Upon arriving at the distant location, he couldn’t help but wish he still had that sparkling beverage.
