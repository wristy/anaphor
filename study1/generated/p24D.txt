Marcus walked into the trendy diner on the corner and ordered a sparkling soda, expecting its effervescence to perk him up. The waiter promptly delivered the chilled drink. Before Marcus could even lift the glass, his phone buzzed with a reminder for a meeting in a corporate office on the far side of town—set to begin in two hours. He decided to enjoy the diner’s ambience a bit longer before hailing a cab for the long journey. When he finally reached the remote office, he couldn’t help but wish for that sparkling beverage.
