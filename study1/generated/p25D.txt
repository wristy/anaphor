Rafael strolled into the neighborhood cafe on a scorching day and ordered an icy lemonade, hoping it would cool him down. The barista handed him the tall glass with a friendly smile. Before Rafael could take a sip, his phone beeped with a reminder for a meeting in a high‐rise office across town—set to begin in two hours. He decided to savor the cafe’s ambience a little longer before hailing a cab for the long journey. When he finally arrived at the remote office, he found himself wishing he still had that icy beverage.
