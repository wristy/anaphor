Elena walked into the quaint patisserie nestled beside her office building, eager for a quick treat. She ordered a fluffy croissant, and the cheerful baker promptly placed it on the counter.
Before she could take a bite, her phone buzzed with an update: her meeting in the building next door had been delayed by an hour.
Elena relaxed for a few minutes at a nearby bench. An hour later, as she strolled back into the familiar building, she still remembered the fluffy pastry sheâ€™d left behind.
