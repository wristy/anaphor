Mia stepped into the small deli tucked beside the train station, excited for the day ahead. She ordered a chilled wrap, and the friendly server quickly prepared it with care.
Before she could savor a bite, her phone buzzed with an update: her train, departing from the station right next door, had been delayed by an hour.
Mia took a moment to review her plans before stepping out. An hour later, as she strolled into the familiar station, she still found herself thinking about the chilled item sheâ€™d left behind.
