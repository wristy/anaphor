Mia stepped into the small deli tucked beside the train station, excited for the day ahead. She ordered a chilled wrap, and the friendly server quickly prepared it with care.
Before Mia could take a bite, her phone buzzed with a reminder: her train, departing from the station right next door, would leave in five minutes.
Mia gathered her things and dashed out. Moments later, as she entered the station, she couldn’t help but think of the chilled item she’d left behind.
