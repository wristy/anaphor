Rafael strolled into the neighborhood cafe on a scorching day and ordered an icy lemonade, hoping it would cool him down. The barista handed him the tall glass with a friendly smile. Before Rafael could take a sip, his phone beeped with a reminder for a meeting in an office building several blocks awayâ€”starting in five minutes. He hurriedly left the cafe and flagged down a taxi to cover the distance. Upon arriving at the distant building, he wished he still had that icy beverage.
