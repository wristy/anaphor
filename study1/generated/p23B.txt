Elena walked into the quaint patisserie in her bustling neighborhood, eager for a quick treat. She ordered a fluffy croissant, and the cheerful baker promptly placed it on the counter.
Almost immediately, her phone buzzed with a reminder: her meeting in a tall office block located several streets away would begin in ten minutes.
Elena grabbed her bag and rushed through busy avenues. When she finally arrived at the distant building, she couldnâ€™t help but long for the fluffy pastry waiting at the patisserie.
