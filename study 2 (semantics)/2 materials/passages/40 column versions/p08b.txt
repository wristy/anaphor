1	A soft breeze swirled
1	Tamika's skirt around her ankles.
1	The only sound in the cemetery
1	was the whispering leaves.
1	Tamika wiped a tear from her cheek
1	as she stood by her mother's grave.
1	Her mother's favorite flowers
2	were white roses. Tamika placed
4	a bouquet of them on the grave.
3	Tamika stepped past the purple lilacs
4	at the gated entrance.
4	She paused at a bench
4	outside the cemetery.
4	She wasn't in a hurry
4	to leave her hometown.
4	She was meeting her friend for lunch
4	in a neighboring town, but
4	that wasn't for several hours.
4	As usual, Tamika was overwhelmed
4	by emotions and memories.
4	She closed her eyes
4	and began to meditate.
4	When she was completely calm, she
4	exhaled deeply and checked her watch.
4	Two hours had gone by! 
4	She crossed the street, got in her car,
4	and set off.  At the outskirts of town,
4	she stopped for a cup of coffee.
4	Tamika savored her warm beverage
4	over the next hour.  When it was finished,
4	she returned to her car
4	and covered the remaining miles
4	to the next town.  The cafe was
4	very busy and Tamika had to wait
4	for a half hour before she was
4	finally seated.  Finally,
4	she plopped down in a seat and sighed.
4	Even though it had been a difficult visit,
4	Tamika was happy that she had put
5	the white flowers on the headstone
6	of her mother's grave.
6	She was sure that her mother
6	would enjoy looking down
6	on those beautiful blooms
6	dancing in the breeze.
