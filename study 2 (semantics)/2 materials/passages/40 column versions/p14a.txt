1	Jenna sat on the blue couch with a sigh.
1	She was here for the weekend doing a job
1	for Mr. and Mrs. Narayan.
1	Jenna hoped to earn enough
1	for her senior ski trip.
1	All she needed to do was to care for
1	their pets while they were
1	away for the weekend.
1	Jenna's first task was to pick up
2	the Narayan's fluffy dog
4	from his vet appointment.
4	She stepped past the food dish
3	of the Narayan's lazy cat
4	and walked outside as small raindrops
4	started to fall.  Jenna didn't
4	mind getting wet
4	so she left her Toyota behind
4	and opened her umbrella.
4	She would walk
4	to the veterinary clinic,
4	which was all the way across town.
4	An hour later,
4	she walked past the bakery.
4	Whenever Jenna ran errands,
4	she would take a few moments
4	to treat herself.  She sat down
4	and lingered over a cup of coffee
4	and a pastry for the next hour.
4	Jenna then continued her journey.
4	She walked another mile,
4	coming to a pet store.
4	Inside, she looked around for an hour
4	before purchasing treats
4	for the Narayan's animals.
4	After another mile of walking,
4	Jenna finally came
4	to the veterinary clinic.
4	There was a long line,
4	so she sank down into one of the chairs.
4	She had to wait another thirty minutes
4	until her name was called.
4	Jenna hurriedly signed
4	the necessary papers
4	while the receptionist walked
4	into the back of the clinic.
4	Jenna smiled as she saw
5	the fluffy animal come galloping
6	into the room.
6	Jenna took the paperwork
6	from the receptionist
6	and walked outside.
