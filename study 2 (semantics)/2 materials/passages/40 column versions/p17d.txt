1	It was late at night when Ryan,
1	a rookie cop, responded to the call.
1	He was eager to start the process
1	that could eventually lead to an arrest.
1	Ryan scanned the scene.
1	His eyes immediately landed on the
2	bloody club lying ominously in the doorway.
4	The only other scene he had investigated
3	was one involving a silver axe.
4	He reached for his kit
4	for processing crime scenes.
4	Just then, he remembered that he
4	had left his kit
4	for processing crime scenes at home.
4	Ryan's superiors hadn't arrived yet,
4	so he took his time walking to his car.
4	Ryan climbed in and started to drive
4	the several miles back to his house.
4	The football game had just ended,
4	and the traffic was heavy.
4	A half hour later,
4	Ryan passed a gas station.
4	His tank was almost empty,
4	so he pulled in and filled it up.
4	The credit card machine was broken
4	so he had to wait in line
4	to pay inside.  Afterwards,
4	Ryan realized that he was hungry.
4	He spent the next thirty minutes
4	searching for a deli
4	that was still open.
4	When he found one,
4	he bought a sandwich
4	and a soft drink.
4	He took them to the park across
4	the street and enjoyed the snack.
4	When he finally arrived at his house,
4	it took him an hour to find his kit. 
4	Mentally, Ryan prepared himself for
4	the next steps he would take
4	in processing the scene.
4	He would start by analyzing
5	the bloody weapon that he found
6	at the house.  He would have to use
6	the equipment to dust for fingerprints.
6	Ryan knew that if he worked methodically,
6	his thorough approach would produce results
6	that would help to apprehend the guilty.
