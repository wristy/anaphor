1	Jessie was excited to hear the results
1	after her husband's participation
1	in yesterday's competition.
1	She knew that her husband grew
2	the sweetest apples anywhere.
4	The judges had already sampled them
4	at the state fair yesterday
4	and would meet with everyone today
4	to share the results.
4	Jessie stepped past
3	a table of tangy oranges
4	and entered the competition area.
4	She needed to locate her husband at the
4	judge's table before the judges arrived.
4	Jessie took out her cell phone
4	and called her husband.
4	She hoped he could give her
4	clear directions to his location.
4	After a brief and tense conversation,
4	she realized that she was
4	on the wrong side of the vast fair!
4	Jessie hung up her phone and decided
4	to enjoy this side of the fair
4	before she met her husband.
4	First, she waited in line for
4	a half hour to get lemonade.
4	For the next hour,
4	she wandered among the booths.
4	When she had seen everything
4	she wanted to see,
4	Jessie strolled back to her car.
4	She drove the two miles
4	to the other side of fair,
4	where her husband was.
4	The traffic was a mess.
4	Forty-five minutes later, Jessie
4	finally arrived at her destination.
4	She perused the countless brown tables
4	covered in hearty food.
4	She stopped to use the restroom
4	and had to wait in the
4	longest line she had ever seen.
4	A half hour later, she finally joined
4	her husband at the judge's table
4	just in time to see the 
4	three judges approach.
4	Jessie was ecstatic when
5	her husband's sweet fruit was announced
6	as the grand prize winner.
6	She jumped up and down
6	in excitement as the oldest judge
6	handed her husband a blue ribbon!
