1	Delilah and Joseph were in the process
1	of moving from Chicago to London.
1	The biggest remaining task
1	was to pack their apartment.
1	The many smaller items had
1	already been packed. All that remained
1	were a couple of the bigger items.
2	They grabbed the wooden table in the
4	dining room and began to
4	dissemble it together.  Joseph searched
4	the remaining empty boxes
4	for one that was big enough.
4	He was glad that they already packed
3	the bulky sofa.
4	Glancing at the clock,
4	Delilah realized that their friends
4	would be coming over to help them in
4	three hours.  They had plenty of time.
4	It took half an hour for Joseph to sort
4	through the remaining boxes.
4	None were big enough. Joseph grabbed
4	his keys and headed to the parking lot.
4	After two miles of heavy traffic,
4	he passed a post office.  He parked and
4	stood in the long line to
4	get a change-of-address form.
4	He filled it out, dropped it in the slot,
4	and continued on his way.
4	A few more miles in the heavy traffic
4	brought him to the bank.  He remembered
4	that he needed to get money
4	to pay the movers.  He parked in the
4	crowded lot and waited in the long line.
4	A half hour later, the teller finally
4	gave him his money. Back on the road,
4	he found the traffic
4	even heavier than before.
4	It took an hour to travel
4	the final two miles to the shipping store.
4	It was very crowded, and it took forever
4	to locate a sufficiently large packing box.
4	There was only one cashier
4	and it took forever to pay for the box.
4	Joseph was about to head back
4	to help Delilah pack the pieces of
5	the wooden furniture when his phone
6	rang.  It was Delilah calling
6	to let him know that the "reinforcements"
6	had arrived.
