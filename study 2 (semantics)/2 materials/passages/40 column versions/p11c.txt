1	The music instructor looked outside.
1	The snow that was falling
1	beyond her window was dense and wet.
1	Running her fingers lovingly
2	over the shabby viola, she sighed.
4	She pushed aside her husband's
3	metal clarinet collection and
4	started to prepare for the day.
4	She was already cold when
4	she struggled into her coat.
4	The music instructor traveled miles
4	every day so she could give students
4	lessons in their homes.
4	Today she dreaded leaving her home.
4	She put her cell phone in her pocket
4	and walked outside.
4	She grabbed the shovel by the door
4	and cleared the driveway.
4	She then started on her ten-mile trip
4	through the elements.  She drove
4	carefully to the house
4	of her first student, Anya.
4	It took longer than usual,
4	but at least she arrived safely.
4	Anya's lesson was an hour long,
4	but she was a poor student,
4	and the time passed very slowly.
4	When she finished, she backed
4	out of the driveway and drove
4	three more miles to her next lesson
4	at Amy's house.  Amy was a much
4	better student.  She made a lot
4	of progress over the next hour
4	with the music instructor's help.
4	The instructor drove two more miles
4	until she reached her final lesson
4	at Jose's house.
4	The hour-long lesson was very frustrating.
4	She returned to her car
4	and started the engine.
4	She was exhausted from the long day.
4	She looked forward
4	to spending the evening in the
4	warmth of her home, her fingers dancing
5	over the shabby instrument that she 
6	had always loved.
6	She couldn't wait to ease
6	into a familiar aria,
6	letting her eyes drift closed
6	so she could completely enjoy
6	the music as she played.
6	She hoped that someday
6	one of her students would find
6	the release and comfort that she did
6	when she sat down on the bench.
