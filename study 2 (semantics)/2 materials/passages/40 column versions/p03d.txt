1	Wiping his brow with the kitchen towel,
1	the chef paused for a moment
1	in his preparations to survey the mess
1	he had created.
1	This meal had to be perfect,
1	flawless from the appetizers
1	to the dessert.
1	Not wanting to waste time,
2	he picked up the metal tongs
4	and continued to prepare
4	the vegetables for the salad.
4	The timer sounded, signaling that it was
4	time to apply the herb rub to the roast.
4	The chef accidently knocked over some
3	plastic bowls in his hurry to whisk
4	the roast out of the oven.
4	Where did he put those spices?
4	How could he have forgotten
4	something like that
4	on such an important day?
4	He must have left them in his catering van.
4	The chef sat down in the kitchen
4	and rested his head on the counter
4	in discouragement.
4	A half hour later,
4	he roused himself
4	and plodded through the rented hall
4	until he reached the exit.
4	Slowly opening the double doors,
4	he started to walk up
4	San Francisco's steepest hill.
4	He strolled past a florist
4	and a pastry shop,
4	but he still had a mile to go
4	before he reached his van,
4	which was parked at the very top.
4	After thirty minutes of walking,
4	the chef was becoming very tired.
4	He looked downhill,
4	along the tracks,
4	but there was no trolley approaching
4	He continued on his journey.
4	His pace slowed.
4	It was an hour before
4	he finally reached his van.
4	He grabbed the forgotten box of spices
4	and breathed a sigh of relief.
4	The chef could envision
4	how everything would go.
4	He would first combine the spices in a bowl.
4	Then, he would slide the seasoned roast
4	back into the oven.  Finally, he would use
5	his metal utensil to complete
6	the preparations.
6	If tonight was successful,
6	he could look forward to an
6	exciting career in the catering business.
