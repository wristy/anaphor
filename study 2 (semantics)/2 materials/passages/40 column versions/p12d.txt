1	Jason and Jenna smiled at each other.
1	It was a wonderful date so far.
2	They climbed out of the vintage schooner.
3	Jason and Jenna walked past a tiny kayak
4	tied to the dock in front of them
4	and continued their date. 
4	They were both hungry and eager
4	for their lunch reservation
4	after spending time on the water.
4	The restaurant was several miles
4	away at the other end of town.
4	Their reservation was in a few hours,
4	so Jason and Jenna took their time
4	strolling through
4	the picturesque streets.
4	They both had gotten sunburned
4	out on the water, so they stopped
4	in the drug store to purchase some aloe.
4	The store was crowded,
4	and it took thirty minutes to find
4	what they were looking for
4	and complete the purchase.
4	As they continued walking,
4	they spotted a wine store.
4	They walked into it and spent
4	the next hour tasting different wines
4	before settling on a bottle
4	to purchase and bring to lunch.
4	They held hands and slowly walked
4	the last mile to the restaurant,
4	arriving thirty minutes
4	late for their reservation.
4	As they were shown to their table,
4	Jason asked Jenna which part of
4	their date she liked the best so far.
4	Jenna quickly said that she had
4	really enjoyed her time
5	in the vintage vessel best
6	but that everything else had been
6	lovely as well.  Then, Jason
6	and Jenna picked up the menu
6	and they prepared to order.
