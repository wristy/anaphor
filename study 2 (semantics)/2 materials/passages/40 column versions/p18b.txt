1	Sarah could hardly believe
1	that her little sister
1	was turning thirteen tomorrow.
1	As usual, she had waited until the
1	last minute to purchase her present.
1	What would a new teenager want?
1	Sarah recalled what was at the top
1	of her wish list at that age: clothes.
1	She was going to find her sister
1	the perfect outfit.
1	Well, maybe not an entire outfit,
1	but Sarah would find her
2	sister a perfect trendy shirt.
3	She wouldn't buy a paisley coat like
4	her mother had purchased for a gift.
4	Sarah had several hours before
4	she needed to be back home
4	for the birthday dinner.
4	She strolled out to her car.
4	She carefully backed out of the driveway
4	and drove into town.  An hour later,
4	Sarah arrived at the mall.
4	Sarah took her time
4	negotiating through the crowds.
4	She browsed for herself
4	before focusing on her sister.
4	Two hours later, Sarah had not found
4	anything she or her sister would like.
4	She returned to her car
4	and drove several more miles
4	through thick traffic.
4	As she passed the hair salon,
4	she decided that she had time
4	to update her highlights.
4	Two hours later,
4	she felt like a new woman.
4	She hopped back into her car
4	and drove on. She arrived at the
4	outlet store and made her way inside.
4	She spent an hour searching through
4	the racks of merchandise.
4	That's when she found it.
4	It was the perfect piece
5	of trendy clothing and she knew
6	her sister would love it.
6	Sarah pushed aside hangers
6	in order to look for her sister's size.
6	She found the correct one
6	and walked to the register.
6	She smiled, anticipating the
6	pleased look on her sister's face.
