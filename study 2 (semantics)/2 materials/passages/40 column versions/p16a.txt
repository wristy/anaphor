1	Keisha looked around
1	the bus stop with a sigh.
1	She couldn't believe her car
1	had broken down again.
1	She sat on a wooden bench
2	and pulled out her glossy magazine.
4	The bench cut into the backs of her legs
4	since she wasn't tall enough
4	for her feet to touch the ground.
3	She pushed aside a tattered newspaper
4	and settled in to wait for the 8:57 bus.
4	She waited and waited but
4	the bus never came.
4	After a half hour,
4	she realized that she had missed it.
4	She had no other choice but to wait
4	patiently for the 10:25 bus.
4	It arrived almost an hour later.
4	Tired and late for work,
4	she took a seat near the front.
4	The traffic was heavy,
4	and the bus started to crawl
4	the few miles to her work.
4	After one mile, it stopped
4	in front of the bakery.
4	Several people slowly boarded.
4	The bus continued along its slow journey.
4	After another mile, it stopped
4	in front of the grocery store.
4	A large number of passengers
4	boarded there.  One mile later,
4	the bus gave a jolt and rolled to a stop.
4	It took an hour for a mechanic to arrive.
4	It took another hour
4	for him to fix the problem.
4	Eventually, the bus
4	shuddered back to life.
4	The traffic was still heavy.
4	A half hour later, the bus finally
4	stopped in front of her work.
4	At that moment, she realized
4	that she had left
5	her glossy reading material on
6	the bench at the bus stop.
6	She crossed her fingers that her car
6	would be fixed by that afternoon,
6	and she would be able to drive to work.
