1	The woman huddled on the floor.  She
1	watched the three men shatter the glass
1	jewelry case with the butts of their guns.
2	The men scooped the glitzy opals
4	into black velvet bags.
4	The woman was hidden behind the case
3	filled with crimson rubies.  
4	She was close to the door that
4	the robbers had carelessly left open.
4	Although scared, she decided to escape
4	and to try to find help.  
4	The woman grabbed her purse and
4	slowly crawled across the floor.
4	A half hour passed before the robbers
4	were distracted enough
4	for her to pass through the door frame.
4	She crawled slowly, careful to avoid
4	jostling the door.  Once outside,
4	she proceeded cautiously down the street,
4	keeping to the shadows to avoid
4	being spotted by a lookout.
4	A half hour later, she came to a bank.
4	She tried to find help, but it was closed.
4	She continued carefully down the road.
4	Not finding anyone, she cut across
4	a construction site.  She tripped over
4	a concrete block, hit her head on a girder,
4	and sunk into unconsciousness.
4	When she finally woke several hours later,
4	her head really hurt.  At this point,
4	she finally remembered
4	the cell phone in her pocket.
4	Feeling stupid, she retrieved it
4	and carefully dialed 911.
4	A little while later,
4	she told the operators that a robbery
4	had taken place. She also mentioned
4	that the thieves
5	had taken glitzy gems from
6	the jewelry store.  
6	The woman closed her cell phone.
6	She was exhausted.
6	She breathed a sigh of relief,
6	thankful that she'd been able to escape
6	and call for help.
