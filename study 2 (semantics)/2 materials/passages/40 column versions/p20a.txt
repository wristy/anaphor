1	The warrior slowly awakened
1	with the morning sun, unprepared for the
1	battle that was still hours away.       
2	He threw on his cotton shirt,
4	bothered not at all by its
4	tattered condition or egregious smell.
3	He set aside his leather hat
4	and spent the next few hours
4	polishing his armor
4	before finally putting it on.
4	He had fought many battles in his life,
4	and had come close to dying several times.
4	Today's battle was just a game, however;
4	a competition to determine
4	the best man in the land.
4	He had fought many men over the years,
4	many stronger than him.
4	He had vanquished them all because combat
4	is not about deploying one's strengths.
4	Rather, it is about exploiting
4	your opponent's weaknesses.
4	These thoughts occupied him for hours.
4	After this contemplation, the warrior
4	realized that it would be a long time
4	until his next meal.  He slowly
4	walked through the village
4	in search of his favorite inn.
4	The warrior sat down to a bit of ale
4	and an old drumstick.  This was his
4	traditional meal before battle.
4	He had actually come to hate drumsticks,
4	but was far too superstitious to change
4	his menu at this point in his life.
4	He methodically consumed the few morsels
4	for the energy they provided.  Afterwards,
4	he resumed his long journey.
4	He traveled for several hours before
4	stopping beside a peaceful brook.
4	The warrior sank his hands into the water.
4	He then wiped his soiled fingers
5	on his cotton clothing before changing
6	into his armor and preparing himself
6	for battle.
