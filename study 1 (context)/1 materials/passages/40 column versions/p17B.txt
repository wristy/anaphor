1	It was late at night when Ryan,
1	a rookie cop, responded to the call.
1	He was eager to start the process
1	that could eventually lead to an arrest.
1	Ryan scanned the scene.
1	His eyes immediately landed on the
2	gleaming gun lying ominously
4	in the doorway.
4	He reached for his kit
4	for processing crime scenes.
4	Just then, he realized
4	that it was missing.
4	Ryan panicked for the next half hour,
4	wondering where it was.
4	There was no way
4	he could collect evidence without it.
4	His scatterbrained ways
4	would get him in trouble some day. 
4	Eventually, Ryan remembered
4	that he had left it in his car.
4	Since his car was parked close by,
4	in the driveway, he decided to relax.
4	His superiors would not arrive
4	for another hour or two.
4	Ryan sat on a couch and
4	flipped on the television.
4	An hour later, he finally rose
4	and walked outside.
4	He looked up at the stars
4	and started daydreaming
4	about the future.
4	He hoped he would
4	rapidly ascend through the ranks.
4	A half hour later, he roused himself
4	and climbed into his car.
4	It took him fifteen minutes
4	to finally locate the kit.  
4	Mentally, Ryan prepared himself for
4	the next steps he would take
4	in processing the scene.
4	He would start with analyzing
5	the gleaming weapon found at the house.
6	He would have to use the equipment
6	to dust for fingerprints.  Ryan knew
6	that if he worked methodically, his
6	thorough approach would produce results
6	that would help to apprehend the guilty.
