1	Following the doctor's visit,
1	The tension in the hospital room
1	was palpable.  All the parents
1	could hear was the echo of the doctor's
1	diagnosis: their daughter was battling
2	an aggressive cancer.  There was so
4	much sadness here.  Of course,
4	it could have been worse.
4	The parents were eager to do something
4	to cheer up their daughter.
4	They decided to find something that
4	would make her smile when she woke up.
4	The father remembered the gift store
4	that he and his wife had seen.
4	The father decided to buy their daughter
4	a new teddy bear.
4	His wife asked him to go to
4	the gift store just down the hall
4	from the daughter's room.
4	She told him to take his time,
4	to take a couple of hours
4	to regain his strength.
4	The father plodded down the 7th floor
4	of the hospital in a state of shock.
4	He leaned against the wall and
4	closed his eyes.  He was tired
4	of the uncertainty.  Over the next hour,
4	he tried to think about happier times.
4	As he opened his eyes,
4	he saw his neighbors coming to visit
4	his daughter. They had brought balloons.
4	The father shared the devastating news.
4	It took an hour to answer
4	all of their questions. When he finished,
4	he walked the few remaining steps
4	to the gift store.  A number of customers
4	were in the store, and it took
4	a half hour to make his purchase.
4	As he exited the store,
4	he took a deep breath.
4	He knew they could be strong
4	as they fought this 
5	aggressive disease as a family.
6	Together, they would
6	make it through this.
