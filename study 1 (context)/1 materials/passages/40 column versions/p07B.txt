1	Jason looked around
1	his high school gymnasium.
1	It was overwhelmed by the
1	large number of booths,
1	each representing a different career.
1	He wanted to pursue a career
1	in the field of education
2	as a motivating teacher, so locating that
4	information table was his top priority.
4	Jason was grateful for
4	the opportunity to learn more
4	about a variety of jobs.
4	His class requirement was to distribute
4	a minimum of three resumes
4	and participate in interviews today.
4	Many of his classmates were frustrated
4	with this requirement.
4	Jason was one of them.
4	He joined a couple of friends
4	in the corner of the gym.
4	They spent an hour complaining about
4	having to attend this event.
4	When his friends departed, Jason had
4	no excuse to not participate
4	in the career fair.
4	He slowly made his way across the gym.
4	He hoped he remembered
4	to bring his paperwork.  In particular,
4	he needed his resumes
4	so that he could distribute them.
4	Jason had spent a tremendous amount of time
4	collecting the requisite information,
4	and formatting it in an appealing way.
4	He was going to be in big trouble
4	if he didn't have them.
4	Jason dumped out
4	the entire contents of his bag
4	onto the gymnasium floor.
4	A half hour later, he 
4	found his stack of resumes
4	under the papers.
4	Jason was relieved he had
4	the necessary paperwork to start looking
5	into the motivating career he was
6	interested in. 
6	He stuffed the stack of resumes
6	in his bag.
