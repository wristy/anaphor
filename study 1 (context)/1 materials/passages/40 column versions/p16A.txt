1	Keisha looked around
1	the bus stop with a sigh.
1	She couldn't believe her car
1	had broken down again.
1	She sat on a wooden bench
2	and pulled out her glossy paperback.
4	The bench cut into the backs of her legs
4	since she wasn't tall enough
4	for her feet to touch the ground.
4	She settled in to wait for the 8:57 bus.
4	Keisha was anxious for the bus to arrive.
4	Although she worked nearby,
4	her knees had been giving her trouble
4	and they made the short walk difficult.
4	Four minutes later,
4	the city bus rounded the corner.
4	Keisha stood up and grabbed her things.
4	She took a moment to stretch her legs.
4	As she stood, she realized that her knees
4	didn't feel too badly after all.
4	Keisha decided to walk
4	the block to her work.
4	She watched the bus pull away.
4	She was glad she had sat for
4	a few minutes on the bench.
4	It gave her knees a chance to loosen up.
4	Keisha stepped away from the bus stop
4	and briskly walked
4	the two blocks to her office.
4	She arrived at work five minutes later.
4	At that moment, she realized that she
5	had left her glossy book on the bench
6	at the bus stop.
6	She crossed her fingers that her car
6	would be fixed by that afternoon,
6	and she would be able to drive to work.
