1	It was late at night when Ryan,
1	a rookie cop, responded to the call.
1	He was eager to start the process
1	that could eventually lead to an arrest.
1	Ryan scanned the scene.
1	His eyes immediately landed on the
2	gleaming gun lying ominously
4	in the doorway.
4	He reached for his kit
4	for processing crime scenes.
4	Just then, he remembered that he
4	had left his kit for processing
4	crime scenes at home.
4	His scatterbrained ways
4	would get him in trouble some day. 
4	Ryan's superiors hadn't arrived yet,
4	so he sprinted to his car
4	in less than a minute.
4	He climbed in and turned on
4	the flashing lights so that he could
4	speed through the neighborhood.
4	After five minutes,
4	he sped past a gas station.
4	He was low on gas, so he stopped
4	just long enough to pump a few gallons.
4	A mile later he flew past
4	a 24-hour grocery store.
4	Although he really didn't have time,
4	he stopped to quickly buy
4	a pack of cigarettes.
4	He covered the two remaining
4	miles to his house
4	in just a few minutes.
4	When he arrived, he raced inside,
4	grabbed his kit,
4	and ran back to his car.  
4	Mentally, Ryan prepared himself for
4	the next steps he would take
4	in processing the scene.
4	He would start with analyzing
5	the gleaming weapon found at the house.
6	He would have to use the equipment
6	to dust for fingerprints.  Ryan knew
6	that if he worked methodically, his
6	thorough approach would produce results
6	that would help to apprehend the guilty.
