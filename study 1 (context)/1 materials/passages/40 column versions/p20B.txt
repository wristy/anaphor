1	The warrior slowly awakened with
1	the morning sun, unprepared for the 
1	battle that was still hours away.  
2	He threw on his wool shirt,
4	bothered not at all by its
4	tattered condition or egregious smell.
4	He spent the next few hours
4	polishing his armor before finally 
4	putting it on.  He had fought
4	many battles in his life,
4	and had come close to dying several times.
4	Today's battle was just a game, however;
4	a competition to determine
4	the best man in the land.  He had fought
4	many men over the years,
4	many stronger than him.
4	He had vanquished them all because combat
4	is not about deploying one's strengths.
4	Rather, it is about exploiting
4	your opponent's weaknesses.
4	These thoughts occupied him for hours.
4	After this contemplation,
4	the warrior realized it would be
4	a long time until his next meal.
4	He carefully examined
4	his stack of provisions.
4	The warrior sat down to a bit of ale and
4	an old drumstick.  This was his 
4	traditional meal before battle.
4	He had actually come to hate
4	drumsticks, but was far too superstitious
4	to change his menu at this point
4	in his life.  He methodically consumed the
4	few morsels for the energy they provided.
4	Tired, he settled in and enjoyed a long,
4	leisurely nap.  When he woke much later, 
4	he walked to the large bowl 
4	of water in the corner and dropped
4	to his knees.  The warrior sank 
4	his hands into the water.
4	He then wiped his soiled fingers
5	on his wool clothing.  Finally,
6	he changed into his armor
6	and prepared himself for battle.
