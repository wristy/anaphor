1	Jason and Jenna smiled at each other.
1	It was a wonderful date so far.
2	They climbed out of the vintage sailboat.
4	They were both hungry and eager
4	for their lunch reservation
4	after spending time on the water.
4	The restaurant was only
4	a few steps away,
4	right next to the dock.
4	Since it was such a beautiful day,
4	Jason and Jenna decided to sit
4	on the edge of the dock with their
4	feet in the water.
4	They soaked up the sun and
4	spent an hour reliving
4	the wonderful things they had
4	done so far.  Finally, Jason and Jenna
4	dried their feet and decided
4	to head to the restaurant.
4	The first time Jason and Jenna ate there,
4	they both agreed that they had never seen
4	such beautiful presentation
4	of the meals they ordered.
4	Moments later, they walked in the door.
4	The hostess informed them
4	that the wait was an hour.
4	They passed the time
4	in the waiting area,
4	planning future adventures.
4	An hour later, the hostess found them.
4	As they were shown to their table,
4	Jason asked Jenna which part of
4	their date she liked the best so far.
4	Jenna quickly said
4	that she really enjoyed her time in
5	the vintage vessel.  Then, Jason
6	and Jenna picked up the menu
6	and they prepared to order.
