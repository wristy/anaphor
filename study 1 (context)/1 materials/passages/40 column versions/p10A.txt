1	Following the doctor's visit,
1	The tension in the hospital room
1	was palpable.  All the parents
1	could hear was the echo of the doctor's
1	diagnosis: their daughter was battling
2	an aggressive cancer.  There was so
4	much sadness here.  Of course,
4	it could have been worse.
4	The parents were eager to do something
4	to cheer up their daughter.
4	They decided to find something that
4	would make her smile when she woke up.
4	The father remembered the gift store
4	that he and his wife had seen.
4	The father decided to buy their daughter
4	a new teddy bear.
4	His wife asked him to hurry.
4	This was easy to do since the gift store
4	was just down the hall from
4	their daughter's room.  Seconds later,
4	the father started sprinting
4	through the 7th floor of the hospital.
4	After a few strides, he saw
4	his neighbors walking down the hall.
4	They had come to visit his daughter.
4	They had brought colorful balloons,
4	but the father pushed past the group.
4	He raced to the gift store.
4	He was the only customer in the store
4	so the purchase was quick. 
4	Just a few minutes after arriving,
4	he exited the store.
4	He was physically tired from his hurrying.
4	He was also emotionally drained.
4	He tucked the teddy bear under his arm
4	and took a deep breath.
4	He knew they could be strong
4	as they fought this 
5	aggressive disease as a family.
6	Together, they would
6	make it through this.
