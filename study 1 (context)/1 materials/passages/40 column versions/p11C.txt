1	The music instructor looked outside.
1	The snow that was falling
1	beyond her window was dense and wet.
1	Running her fingers lovingly
2	over the shabby piano, she sighed.
4	She prepared for the day.
4	She was already cold when she
4	struggled into her coat.
4	The music instructor traveled
4	several miles each day so she could
4	give students lessons in their homes.
4	She put her cell phone in her pocket
4	and set out into the cold.
4	Jumping into her car, she drove
4	as quickly as the weather allowed
4	to her first student, Anya.
4	As the music instructor pulled into
4	the driveway, the phone rang.
4	Anya was calling to cancel,
4	explaining that she hadn't practiced
4	the past week.  The music instructor
4	backed out of the driveway.
4	A few minutes and a few miles later,
4	she arrived at Amy's house.
4	When Amy opened the door,
4	she was still wearing her pajamas.
4	She was sick and had forgotten
4	to call to cancel her lesson.
4	Frustrated, the music instructor
4	jumped back in her car.
4	She had barely left Amy's street
4	when her phone rang.  It was Jose,
4	calling to reschedule his lesson.
4	The day had been a complete failure.
4	She turned the car around
4	and started heading home,
4	just a few minutes after
4	she had started her trip.
4	She looked forward to spending
4	the afternoon back inside the
4	warmth of her home, her fingers dancing
5	over the shabby instrument she loved.
6	She couldn't wait to ease
6	into a familiar aria,
6	letting her eyes drift closed
6	so she could completely enjoy
6	the music as she played.
6	She hoped that someday
6	one of her students would find
6	the release and comfort that she did
6	when she sat down on the bench.
