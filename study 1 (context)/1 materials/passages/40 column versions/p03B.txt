1	Wiping his brow with the kitchen towel,
1	the chef paused for a moment
1	in his preparations to survey the mess
1	he had created.
1	This meal had to be perfect,
1	flawless from the appetizers
1	to the dessert.
1	Not wanting to waste time,
2	he picked up the gleaming knife
4	and continued to cut
4	the vegetables for the salad.
4	The timer sounded, signaling that it was
4	time to apply the herb rub to the roast.
4	Where did he put those spices?
4	How could he have forgotten
4	something like that
4	on such an important day?
4	He must have left them in his catering van.
4	Discouraged, the chef couldn't believe
4	that he wasn't prepared for this.
4	Some of the city's
4	most important people would be
4	attending this dinner.
4	These worries occupied the chef's mind
4	for quite awhile.
4	An hour later, a florist arrived
4	to deliver the centerpieces.
4	The chef spent a long time
4	arguing with the florist about
4	the best placement for the flowers
4	as they set up the tables.
4	Over an hour later,
4	a pastry chef arrived
4	with the desserts for the event.
4	The chef stood up
4	to look at the desserts.
4	He spent a half hour talking to the chef
4	about a future event
4	he was catering where
4	he would also need desserts.
4	It was then that he spotted his
4	box of spices
4	sitting on the first table!
4	He must have set it down
4	on his way into the kitchen.
4	The chef straightened his shoulders.
4	He could envision how everything would go.
4	He would first combine the spices in a bowl.
4	Then, he would slide the seasoned roast
4	back into the oven.  Finally, he would use
5	his gleaming utensil to complete
6	the preparations.
6	If tonight was successful,
6	he could look forward to an
6	exciting career in the catering business.
