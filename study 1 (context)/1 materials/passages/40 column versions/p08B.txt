1	A soft breeze swirled
1	Tamika's skirt around her ankles.
1	The only sound in the cemetery
1	was the whispering leaves.
1	Tamika wiped a tear from her cheek
1	as she stood by her mother's grave.
1	Her mother's favorite flowers
2	were yellow roses. Tamika placed
4	a bouquet of them on the grave.
4	She paused at a bench
4	outside the cemetery.
4	She wasn't in a hurry to leave.
4	She didn't get back to
4	her hometown very often.
4	She had even arranged
4	to have lunch with an old friend.
4	They would meet at the cafe
4	across the street, but that
4	wasn't for three more hours.
4	As usual, Tamika was overwhelmed
4	by emotions and memories.
4	When she felt this way,
4	meditation often helped
4	her find her center.
4	She closed her eyes and went
4	through her mental exercises.
4	As she did, she felt the stress
4	leave her body.
4	When she was completely calm, she
4	exhaled deeply and checked her watch.
4	Two hours had gone by!
4	She walked across
4	the street to the cafe.
4	It was very busy and Tamika had to
4	wait for a half hour
4	before a table was free.  Eventually,
4	she plopped down in a seat and sighed.
4	Even though it had been a difficult visit,
4	Tamika was happy that she had put
5	the yellow flowers on her mother's grave.
6	She was sure that her mother
6	would enjoy looking down
6	on those beautiful blooms
6	dancing in the breeze.
