1	A soft breeze swirled
1	Tamika's skirt around her ankles.
1	The only sound in the cemetery
1	was the whispering leaves.
1	Tamika wiped a tear from her cheek
1	as she stood by her mother's grave.
1	Her mother's favorite flowers
2	were yellow roses. Tamika placed
4	a bouquet of them on the grave.
4	She hurried out of the cemetery.
4	She did not want to be in that place
4	any longer than necessary.
4	Some people like to linger
4	in the places where their loved ones rest,
4	but this was not Tamika's preference.
4	Her visit to her mother's grave was over.
4	As usual, she was overwhelmed
4	by emotions and memories.  Besides,
4	she was meeting her friend for lunch
4	in the cafe across the street.
4	Tamika was very hungry
4	and was glad their meeting
4	was in only five minutes.
4	Looking briefly in both directions,
4	Tamika dashed across the street.
4	Seconds later, she stepped from the cold
4	into the warmth of the cafe.
4	There were plenty of open tables.
4	Tamika chose the one closest to the door.
4	Even though it had been a difficult visit,
4	Tamika was happy that she had put
5	the yellow flowers on her mother's grave.
6	She was sure that her mother
6	would enjoy looking down
6	on those beautiful blooms
6	dancing in the breeze.
