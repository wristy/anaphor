1	The two girls had never been to the zoo.
1	This trip with their father, Jared,
1	would be the first.
1	The girls endlessly reminded their father
2	that they had to see the fierce lion
4	while they were there.
4	Jared reminded his girls
4	of the other animals that they could see
4	but the girls would not be
4	distracted from their goal.
4	They lumbered around their house as
4	they tried to get ready to go.
4	The girls complained long and hard
4	about brushing their teeth.
4	Twenty minutes later,
4	they finally consented to this chore.
4	After combing their hair,
4	the family was finally ready
4	to leave the house.
4	They were already an hour
4	behind schedule! They piled into
4	the family's minivan.
4	Traffic was heavy, and it took
4	another hour to cover
4	the ten miles to the zoo.
4	When they arrived,
4	Jared searched the parking lot.
4	The only parking spot
4	was far from the zoo's entrance.
4	He grabbed his girls by their hands
4	and they slowly made
4	their way to the exhibit.
4	Jumping up and down in excitement,
4	the girls could finally see
5	the fierce animal in the distance.
6	After the girls had their fill
6	of looking at that exhibit,
6	they smiled with satisfaction.
6	The zoo had been a success.
