1	Delilah and Joseph were in the process
1	of moving from Chicago to London.
1	The biggest remaining task
1	was to pack their apartment.
1	The many smaller items had
1	already been packed. All that remained
1	were a couple of the bigger items.
2	They grabbed the wooden table in the
4	dining room and began to
4	dissemble it together.  Joseph searched
4	the remaining empty boxes
4	for one that was big enough.
4	Glancing at the clock,
4	Delilah realized that their friends
4	would be coming over to help them
4	in twenty minutes.
4	She looked over at the boxes
4	that Joseph was sorting through.
4	Panicking, she realized
4	that none were big enough.
4	Joseph saw his wife's distress.
4	He needed to find a solution
4	to the problem, and quick.
4	He grabbed the car keys and was about to
4	head out to buy a box.  Just then,
4	he remembered something
4	that could help their situation.
4	He had purchased a large packing box
4	yesterday that he hadn't put with the others.
4	It was just across the hall
4	in their storage locker.
4	Joseph stepped across the hall and quickly
4	located the target of his search.
4	As he picked it up, his stomach grumbled.
4	Unfortunately, there was no time to eat.
4	Their friends would be here any moment.
4	Joseph was about to head back
4	to help Delilah pack the pieces of
5	the wooden furniture when his phone rang.
6	It was Delilah calling to let him know
6	that the "reinforcements" had arrived.
