1	The music instructor looked outside.
1	The snow that was falling
1	beyond her window was dense and wet.
1	Running her fingers lovingly
2	over the shabby piano, she sighed.
4	She prepared for the day.
4	She was already cold so she
4	wrapped another sweater
4	around her thin shoulders.
4	The day's lessons were about to start.
4	Students traveled to her home every day.
4	The music instructor liked this arrangement.
4	It was convenient because
4	she didn't have to leave her home.
4	All she had to do was to
4	wait for the students to arrive.
4	The music instructor waited for
4	only two minutes when her phone rang.
4	It was her first student calling to cancel.
4	The instructor settled in
4	to wait for the second student.
4	But only one minute later,
4	her phone rang again.
4	It was that student,
4	also calling to cancel!
4	The music instructor had barely
4	hung up her cell when she heard from
4	the third and final student of the day.
4	He was also calling to cancel his lesson.
4	The instructor suddenly had
4	no lessons to teach for the day.
4	Only a few minutes had passed.
4	The music instructor
4	hadn't even left her chair.  Getting up,
4	she walked to the front door
4	to retrieve the day's mail.
4	She looked forward
4	to spending the afternoon in the 
4	warmth of her home, her fingers dancing
5	over the shabby instrument she loved.
6	She couldn't wait to ease
6	into a familiar aria,
6	letting her eyes drift closed
6	so she could completely enjoy
6	the music as she played.
6	She hoped that someday
6	one of her students would find
6	the release and comfort that she did
6	when she sat down on the bench.
