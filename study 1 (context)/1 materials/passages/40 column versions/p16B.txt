1	Keisha looked around
1	the bus stop with a sigh.
1	She couldn't believe her car
1	had broken down again.
1	She sat on a wooden bench
2	and pulled out her glossy paperback.
4	The bench cut into the backs of her legs
4	since she wasn't tall enough
4	for her feet to touch the ground.
4	She settled in to wait for the 8:57 bus.
4	She waited and waited
4	but the bus never came.
4	After a half hour,
4	she realized that she had missed it.
4	She had no other choice
4	but to wait for the 10:25 bus.
4	Just then, her phone rang.
4	It was her mother, who loved to talk.
4	It took an hour before
4	Keisha could say goodbye
4	and get off the phone.
4	The 10:25 bus had yet to arrive.
4	Keisha decided to just walk the block
4	to her work.  Keisha stood up
4	and grabbed her things.
4	She took a moment to stretch her legs.
4	She had been sitting on the bench
4	for almost two hours,
4	and her knees were quite stiff.
4	She slowly walked
4	the two blocks to her office.
4	She arrived at work twenty minutes later.
4	At that moment, she realized that she
5	had left her glossy book on the bench
6	at the bus stop.
6	She crossed her fingers that her car
6	would be fixed by that afternoon,
6	and she would be able to drive to work.
