1	Jenna sat on the blue couch with a sigh.
1	She was here for the weekend doing a job
1	for Mr. and Mrs. Narayan.
1	Jenna hoped to earn enough
1	for her senior ski trip.
1	All she needed to do was to care for
1	their pets while they were
1	away for the weekend.
1	Jenna's first task was to pick up
2	the Narayan's friendly dog
4	from his vet appointment.
4	She walked outside
4	as small raindrops
4	started to fall.  Jenna didn't
4	mind getting wet so
4	she left her Toyota behind
4	and opened her umbrella.
4	She would walk to the veterinary clinic,
4	which was just a couple blocks away.
4	Jenna strolled down the driveway.
4	At the end of the driveway,
4	she stood with her eyes closed
4	and listened to the sound
4	of the rain hitting her umbrella.
4	She loved that sound.
4	A half hour later,
4	Jenna started her stroll to the vet.
4	Jenna had to be very careful
4	where she stepped because deep puddles
4	had formed, and she didn't want
4	to ruin her shoes.  She didn't mind
4	her slow progress though;
4	she loved the rain.
4	Finally, Jenna walked
4	into the veterinary clinic.
4	There was a long line,
4	so she sank down into one of the chairs.
4	She had to wait another thirty minutes
4	until her name was called.
4	Jenna hurriedly signed
4	the necessary papers
4	while the receptionist walked
4	into the back of the clinic.
4	Jenna smiled as she saw
5	the friendly animal come galloping
6	into the room.
6	Jenna took the leash
6	from the receptionist
6	and walked outside.
