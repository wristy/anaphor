1	Everyone squeezed into the family room,
1	anxious to begin the treasure hunt,
1	an annual family tradition.
1	Joshua loved the party atmosphere
1	and could hardly wait
1	for the day's activities.
1	Children pushed and giggled
1	and the adults gossiped until
1	the booming voice
2	of the jolly uncle could be
4	heard over the excited crowd.
4	"Everyone knows how this works,"
4	he shouted.  "I've hidden the family trophy.
4	We end today's search at the park next door.
4	Remember, the first one to find it
4	receives the cash prize
4	and bragging rights for a year.
4	Same rules as always!
4	Ready, set... Go!"
4	Joshua's heart fluttered in excitement.
4	The trophy was hidden
4	somewhere in the house.
4	Joshua took a few seconds
4	to think about his strategy.
4	He loved challenges like these.  
4	He wanted to escape the notice of the
4	others before he started his search.
4	He had a pretty good idea
4	where the treasure might be hidden.
4	Luckily, the room cleared in a few minutes
4	as everyone raced to the
4	more obvious hiding areas:
4	the attic and the basement.
4	Joshua looked around to make sure that
4	no one was in the vicinity
4	of the family room, and then
4	he began his search right there.
4	Minutes later, he carefully climbed
4	the tall bookcase and
4	pulled the trophy from the top shelf
4	where it was hidden behind some volumes.
4	Joshua jumped down and shouted his success.
5	The jolly relative rang a large bell
6	to signal the end of the treasure hunt.
6	Once everyone had gathered in the park,
6	he picked up the excited boy and,
6	holding him high,
6	pronounced Joshua the winner.
6	The family surrounded the boy
6	with their congratulations;
6	the younger ones helping Joshua
6	celebrate his new windfall.
6	Still laughing and talking,
6	the family sat at the picnic table
6	for the celebratory meal.
