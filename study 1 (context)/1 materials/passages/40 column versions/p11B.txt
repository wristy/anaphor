1	The music instructor looked outside.
1	The snow that was falling
1	beyond her window was dense and wet.
1	Running her fingers lovingly
2	over the shabby piano, she sighed.
4	She prepared for the day.
4	She was already cold
4	so she wrapped another sweater
4	around her thin shoulders.
4	The day's lessons were about to begin.
4	Students traveled to her home
4	for lessons every day.
4	The music instructor
4	liked this arrangement.
4	It was convenient because she didn't
4	have to leave her home.
4	The music instructor had to wait
4	half an hour for her first
4	student to arrive.
4	Anya's lesson was an hour long,
4	but she was poorly prepared,
4	and the time passed very slowly.
4	There was a half hour gap
4	before the next student arrived.
4	Amy was a much better student.
4	She made a lot of progress
4	over the next hour with
4	the music instructor's help.
4	That left the music instructor
4	with only one more lesson for the day:
4	Jose.  Jose was late as usual.
4	Not surprisingly, he had not practiced
4	since she saw him last.  The hour-long
4	lesson was very frustrating.
4	As she closed the door behind him,
4	she pondered whether to continue
4	as his teacher.  By this time
4	in the day, the music instructor
4	was exhausted.  Her work was done
4	and now she looked forward
4	to spending the evening in the
4	warmth of her home, her fingers dancing
5	over the shabby instrument she loved.
6	She couldn't wait to ease
6	into a familiar aria,
6	letting her eyes drift closed
6	so she could completely enjoy
6	the music as she played.
6	She hoped that someday
6	one of her students would find
6	the release and comfort that she did
6	when she sat down on the bench.
