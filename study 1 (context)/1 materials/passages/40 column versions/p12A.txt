1	Jason and Jenna smiled at each other.
1	It was a wonderful date so far.
2	They climbed out of the vintage sailboat.
4	They were both hungry and eager
4	for their lunch reservation
4	after spending time on the water.
4	The restaurant was only a few steps away,
4	right next to the dock.  This restaurant
4	was always busy
4	because it boasted beautiful views
4	from practically any table.
4	It also had a reputation
4	for culinary creativity and expertise.
4	The first time Jason and Jenna ate there,
4	they both agreed that they had never
4	seen such beautiful presentation
4	of the meals they ordered.
4	They were looking forward to
4	a similar experience today.  
4	Jason and Jenna hustled up the dock
4	because they did not want
4	to lose their reservation.
4	They had to make this reservation
4	almost three weeks in advance
4	in order to have a window seat
4	during the lunch rush.  Jason and Jenna
4	arrived at the restaurant
4	five minutes later.
4	They had made it on time.
4	As they were shown to their table,
4	Jason asked Jenna which part of
4	their date she liked the best so far.
4	Jenna quickly said
4	that she really enjoyed her time in
5	the vintage vessel.  Then, Jason
6	and Jenna picked up the menu
6	and they prepared to order.
