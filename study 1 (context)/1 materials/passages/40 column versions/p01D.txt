1	Sophia straightened her suit,
1	took a deep breath,
1	and entered the hotel's bar,
1	just off the lobby.  She took a seat
1	at an empty high-top table.
2	She ordered an amber beer,
4	hoping to calm her nerves.
4	The waitress set Sophia's drink 
4	on the table and moved on.
4	Before Sophia could even take a sip,
4	her cell phone rang.
4	It was the client
4	calling to confirm their meeting
4	in the lobby of the Madison Hotel.
4	The Madison Hotel? 
4	Sophia was sitting
4	in the wrong hotel.
4	The Madison was
4	several miles away!
4	She maintained her composure
4	and assured the client
4	that their meeting together
4	would begin in two hours.
4	Sophia hung up her phone
4	and reviewed her papers
4	for the next hour before she
4	left the hotel.
4	By this time, it was
4	raining heavily outside.
4	Sophia stopped at
4	the drugstore down the block
4	to buy an umbrella.
4	The store was crowded and
4	it took half an hour
4	to complete the purchase.
4	Stepping back onto the street,
4	she decided to walk
4	instead of taking a cab.
4	This would give her time
4	to find her focus.
4	An hour later, Sophia finally
4	arrived at the Madison Hotel.
4	Despite her umbrella,
4	she was soaking wet so
4	she headed to the restroom
4	to freshen up.
4	A half hour later,
4	Sophia walked through the lobby
4	where she saw the client
4	impatiently waiting.
4	He rose from his chair
4	and instantly launched into a list
4	of his complaints.
4	Sophia pasted a smile on her face
4	and found herself wishing
5	for the amber beverage she left
6	back in the bar.  
6	She mentally prepared herself for 
6	what was sure to be a difficult meeting.
