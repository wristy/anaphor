1	Keisha looked around
1	the bus stop with a sigh.
1	She couldn't believe her car
1	had broken down again.
1	She sat on a wooden bench
2	and pulled out her glossy paperback.
4	The bench cut into the backs of her legs
4	since she wasn't tall enough
4	for her feet to touch the ground.
4	She settled in to wait for the 8:57 bus.
4	Keisha was anxious for a bus to arrive.
4	Four minutes later,
4	it rounded the corner.
4	Keisha grabbed her things
4	and boarded the bus.
4	She took a seat near the front.
4	She gazed out the window as the bus
4	started to speed
4	the several miles to her work.
4	After two minutes,
4	the bus passed her favorite bakery.
4	They sold delicious pastries there.
4	A few minutes later,
4	the bus sped past the bus stop
4	in front of the grocery store.
4	It didn't stop because there were no
4	people waiting at that bus stop.
4	Instead, it continued
4	along its speedy journey.
4	One mile later,
4	the bus gave a violent jolt.
4	Fearing they'd have
4	mechanical difficulties, Keisha was
4	relieved when the bus
4	shuddered back to normal.
4	She was now only
4	five miles from her building.
4	The bus continued to make great time.
4	Five minutes later, it arrived
4	at the stop in front of her work.
4	At that moment, she realized that she
5	had left her glossy book on the bench
6	at the bus stop.
6	She crossed her fingers that her car
6	would be fixed by that afternoon,
6	and she would be able to drive to work.
