1	Sarah could hardly believe
1	that her little sister
1	was turning thirteen tomorrow.
1	As usual, she had waited until the
1	last minute to purchase her present.
1	What would a new teenager want?
1	Sarah recalled what was at the top
1	of her wish list at that age: clothes.
1	She was going to find her sister
1	the perfect outfit.
1	Well, maybe not an entire outfit,
1	but Sarah would find her
2	a pair of trendy pants.
4	Sarah had only thirty minutes
4	before she had to be back home
4	for the birthday dinner.
4	This meant she really needed to rush! 
4	She was glad she had come to this store
4	to search for her sister's present.
4	It was a chic boutique that catered to
4	the tastes of the young
4	and the fashionable.
4	Her sister was very picky
4	and only a few items would fit her style.
4	Sarah surveyed the empty store.
4	It would only take a few minutes
4	to survey the inventory.  Unfortunately,
4	she didn't have the time
4	to look for anything for herself.
4	Her focus was completely on her sister.
4	Sarah examined the first rack.
4	Mere seconds later, she found it.
4	It was the perfect piece
5	of trendy clothing.  Sarah knew
6	her sister would love it.
6	She pushed aside hangers
6	in order to look for her sister's size.
6	She found the correct one
6	and walked to the register.
6	She smiled, anticipating the
6	pleased look on her sister's face.
