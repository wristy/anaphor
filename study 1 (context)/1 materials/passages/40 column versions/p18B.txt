1	Sarah could hardly believe
1	that her little sister
1	was turning thirteen tomorrow.
1	As usual, she had waited until the
1	last minute to purchase her present.
1	What would a new teenager want?
1	Sarah recalled what was at the top
1	of her wish list at that age: clothes.
1	She was going to find her sister
1	the perfect outfit.
1	Well, maybe not an entire outfit,
1	but Sarah would find her
2	a pair of trendy pants.
4	Sarah had several hours before
4	she needed to be back home
4	for the birthday dinner.
4	She was glad she had come to this store
4	to search for her sister's present.
4	It was a chic boutique that catered
4	to the tastes of the young and the
4	fashionable.  First, Sarah searched
4	the store for something for herself.
4	She tried on racks of coats for an hour
4	without any luck.
4	She then switched to shoes.
4	An hour and many pairs later,
4	still no luck.  Exhausted, she finally
4	shifted her focus to her sister's present.
4	Sarah spent the next hour
4	re-evaluating the store's inventory.
4	It was tiring pushing through
4	the thick crowds. She had almost lost hope
4	when she came to the last rack.
4	That's where she found it.
4	It was the perfect piece
5	of trendy clothing.  Sarah knew
6	her sister would love it.
6	She pushed aside hangers
6	in order to look for her sister's size.
6	She found the correct one
6	and walked to the register.
6	She smiled, anticipating the
6	pleased look on her sister's face.
