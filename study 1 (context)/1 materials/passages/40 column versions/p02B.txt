1	Everyone squeezed into the family room,
1	anxious to begin the treasure hunt,
1	an annual family tradition.
1	Joshua loved the party atmosphere
1	and could hardly wait
1	for the day's activities.
1	Children pushed and giggled
1	and the adults gossiped until
1	the booming voice
2	of the jolly uncle could be
4	heard over the excited crowd.
4	"Everyone knows how this works,"
4	he shouted.  "I've hidden the family trophy.
4	We end today's search at the park next door.
4	Remember, the first one to find it
4	receives the cash prize
4	and bragging rights for a year.
4	Same rules as always!
4	Ready, set... Go!"
4	Joshua's heart fluttered in excitement.
4	The trophy was hidden
4	somewhere in the house.
4	Joshua sat on the couch and
4	took several minutes
4	to think about his strategy.
4	He wanted to escape the notice of
4	the others before he started his search.
4	He had a pretty good idea
4	where the treasure might be hidden.
4	Unfortunately, many of the adults
4	stayed behind and talked
4	since they hadn't seen
4	each other in awhile.
4	Joshua leaned back on the couch
4	and stared at the bookcase
4	across from him.
4	He saw the edge of the trophy
4	sticking out from behind
4	some volumes on the top shelf.
4	Trying to appear casual, he had to
4	wait over an hour for everyone to leave.
4	Finally, the room was clear!
4	Joshua searched the room
4	for something to stand on
4	so he could reach the top shelf.
4	Much later, he decided he must just
4	carefully climb up the tall bookcase.
4	He pulled the trophy from the top shelf.  
4	Joshua climbed down and
4	shouted his success.
5	The jolly relative rang a large bell
6	to signal the end of the treasure hunt.
6	Once everyone had gathered in the park,
6	he picked up the excited boy and,
6	holding him high,
6	pronounced Joshua the winner.
6	The family surrounded the boy
6	with their congratulations;
6	the younger ones helping Joshua
6	celebrate his new windfall.
6	Still laughing and talking,
6	the family sat at the picnic table
6	for the celebratory meal.
