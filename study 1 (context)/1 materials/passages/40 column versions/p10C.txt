1	Following the doctor's visit,
1	The tension in the hospital room
1	was palpable.  All the parents
1	could hear was the echo of the doctor's
1	diagnosis: their daughter was battling
2	an aggressive cancer.  There was so
4	much sadness here.  Of course,
4	it could have been worse.
4	The parents were eager to do something
4	to cheer up their daughter.
4	They decided to find something that
4	would make her smile when she woke up.
4	The father remembered the gift store
4	that he and his wife had seen.
4	The father decided to buy their daughter
4	a new teddy bear.
4	His wife asked him to hurry.
4	This would be difficult because
4	the gift store was several blocks away.
4	The father sprinted through
4	the 7th floor of the hospital.
4	He didn't have time
4	to wait for the elevator,
4	so he ran down the stairs in record time.
4	Seconds later, he was in the lobby.
4	He saw his neighbors
4	holding colorful balloons
4	for his daughter,
4	but he pushed past them
4	and sprinted out of the hospital.
4	The father covered the several blocks
4	to the gift store in no time at all.
4	Thoughts of his daughter
4	raced through his mind.
4	He was the only customer in the store
4	so the purchase was quick.
4	Just a few minutes after arriving,
4	he exited the store.
4	He was physically tired
4	from his hurrying and emotionally drained.
4	He tucked the teddy bear
4	under his arm and took a deep breath.
4	He knew they could be strong
4	as they fought this 
5	aggressive disease as a family.
6	Together, they would
6	make it through this.
