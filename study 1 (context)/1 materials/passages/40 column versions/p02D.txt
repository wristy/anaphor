1	Everyone squeezed into the family room,
1	anxious to begin the treasure hunt,
1	an annual family tradition.
1	Joshua loved the party atmosphere
1	and could hardly wait
1	for the day's activities.
1	Children pushed and giggled
1	and the adults gossiped until
1	the booming voice
2	of the jolly uncle could be
4	heard over the excited crowd.
4	"Everyone knows how this works,"
4	he shouted.  "I've hidden the family trophy.
4	We end today's search at the park next door.
4	Remember, the first one to find it
4	receives the cash prize
4	and bragging rights for a year.
4	Same rules as always!
4	Ready, set... Go!"
4	Joshua's heart fluttered in excitement.
4	The trophy was hidden
4	somewhere in the neighborhood.
4	Joshua wanted to be sure
4	he wouldn't be followed.
4	After a half hour of waiting,
4	he was finally able to
4	leave the house.
4	He crept down several streets.
4	Joshua peeked around a corner,
4	and made his way past several houses.
4	Twenty minutes later,
4	he ducked around a corner
4	when he spotted some cousins
4	in the distance.
4	He hid from them by crouching
4	behind a rock.
4	Thirty minutes later, he ran past
4	several houses, arriving at the yard
4	with the hollow tree.
4	Climbing the fence, he
4	tore his pants in his haste.
4	Joshua walked to the other side,
4	finally reaching the tree.  Wrong one.
4	He checked the other trees in the yard,
4	finally coming to the last one
4	several minutes later.
4	Joshua peered inside
4	and discovered the hidden treasure.
4	He took some time 
4	to celebrate his victory.
4	Then, Joshua grabbed the trophy
4	and strolled to the park 
4	three blocks down.
5	The jolly relative rang a large bell
6	to signal the end of the treasure hunt.
6	Once everyone had gathered in the park,
6	he picked up the excited boy and,
6	holding him high,
6	pronounced Joshua the winner.
6	The family surrounded the boy
6	with their congratulations;
6	the younger ones helping Joshua
6	celebrate his new windfall.
6	Still laughing and talking,
6	the family sat at the picnic table
6	for the celebratory meal.
