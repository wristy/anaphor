1	Jenna sat on the blue couch with a sigh.
1	She was here for the weekend doing a job
1	for Mr. and Mrs. Narayan.
1	Jenna hoped to earn enough
1	for her senior ski trip.
1	All she needed to do was to care for
1	their pets while they were
1	away for the weekend.
1	Jenna's first task was to pick up
2	the Narayan's friendly dog
4	from his vet appointment.
4	She walked outside
4	as small raindrops
4	started to fall.  Jenna didn't
4	want to get too wet.
4	She closed her umbrella
4	and hopped into her Toyota.
4	She would drive to the veterinary clinic,
4	which was just a couple blocks away.
4	Jenna backed the car down the driveway.
4	It momentarily crossed her mind
4	that the Narayans were lucky
4	to have an animal clinic so close by.
4	She had lost a pet once
4	because she couldn't get it
4	to the veterinarian quickly enough.
4	Jenna sped through
4	the beautiful neighborhood.
4	Minutes later, she pulled into
4	the parking lot of the veterinary clinic.
4	She had made it in record time:
4	five minutes!  She ran inside
4	and was happy to find there was no line.
4	She wrote her name on the list
4	and waited patiently.
4	The receptionist called her name
4	just a few minutes later.
4	Jenna hurriedly signed
4	the necessary papers
4	while the receptionist walked
4	into the back of the clinic.
4	Jenna smiled as she saw
5	the friendly animal come galloping
6	into the room.
6	Jenna took the leash
6	from the receptionist
6	and walked outside.
