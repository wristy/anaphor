1	Jason looked around
1	his high school gymnasium.
1	It was overwhelmed by the
1	large number of booths,
1	each representing a different career.
1	He wanted to pursue a career
1	in the field of education
2	as a motivating teacher, so locating that
4	information table was his top priority.
4	Jason was grateful for
4	the opportunity to learn more
4	about a variety of jobs.
4	His class requirement was to distribute
4	a minimum of three resumes
4	and participate in interviews today.
4	Many of his classmates today
4	were frustrated with this requirement.
4	Jason, however, was actually looking
4	forward to doing some research
4	about possible career paths.
4	He started to walk across the gym.
4	He hoped he remembered
4	to bring his paperwork.  In particular,
4	he needed his resumes
4	so that he could distribute them.
4	Jason had spent
4	a tremendous amount of time
4	collecting the requisite information,
4	and formatting it in an appealing way.
4	He was going to be in big trouble
4	if he didn't have them.
4	Jason felt panic for
4	the briefest of moments.  However,
4	he quickly regained his composure.
4	He was usually responsible
4	and thorough when it came to such details.
4	He reached his hand into his bag
4	and began rummaging around.
4	Seconds later, he 
4	found his stack of resumes
4	under the papers.
4	Jason was relieved he had
4	the necessary paperwork to start looking
5	into the motivating career he was
6	interested in. 
6	He stuffed the stack of resumes
6	in his bag.
