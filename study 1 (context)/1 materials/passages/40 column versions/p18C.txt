1	Sarah could hardly believe
1	that her little sister
1	was turning thirteen tomorrow.
1	As usual, she had waited until the
1	last minute to purchase her present.
1	What would a new teenager want?
1	Sarah recalled what was at the top
1	of her wish list at that age: clothes.
1	She was going to find her sister
1	the perfect outfit.
1	Well, maybe not an entire outfit,
1	but Sarah would find her
2	a pair of trendy pants.
4	Sarah had only thirty minutes
4	before she had to be back home
4	for the birthday dinner.
4	She ran to her car.
4	She flew out of the driveway
4	and sped into town.  Five minutes later,
4	Sarah arrived at the mall.
4	She knew there was a chic boutique there.
4	She pushed her way inside.
4	Five minutes later, she hadn't seen
4	anything her sister would like.
4	She jumped back in her car and sped off.
4	On the left, Sarah passed the hair salon. 
4	Remembering that she was out of shampoo,
4	she ducked in and bought a bottle.
4	She then continued on her journey.
4	She flew into the parking lot
4	of the outlet store and ran inside.
4	She found what she was
4	looking for immediately.
4	It was the perfect piece
5	of trendy clothing.  Sarah knew
6	her sister would love it.
6	She pushed aside hangers
6	in order to look for her sister's size.
6	She found the correct one
6	and walked to the register.
6	She smiled, anticipating the
6	pleased look on her sister's face.
