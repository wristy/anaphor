1	Sophia straightened her suit,
1	took a deep breath,
1	and entered the hotel's bar,
1	just off the lobby.  She took a seat
1	at an empty high-top table.
2	She ordered an amber beer,
4	hoping to calm her nerves.
4	The waitress set Sophia's drink 
4	on the table and moved on.
4	Before Sophia could even take a sip,
4	her cell phone rang.
4	It was the client
4	calling to confirm their meeting
4	in the lobby of the Madison Hotel.
4	Sophia checked her watch
4	and confirmed that their meeting
4	would begin in two hours.
4	She hung up her phone
4	and took a deep breath.
4	Sophia was not looking forward to
4	meeting with this client.
4	She spent the next half hour
4	recalling how their
4	last interaction had gone.
4	His arrogant attitude always
4	put her on edge.
4	Sophia made room
4	on the table for some papers and
4	dumped the contents
4	of her briefcase in front of her.
4	She spent over an hour
4	sorting through the documents
4	and rehearsing her presentation.
4	Then, Sophia realized
4	she couldn't possibly be more prepared
4	than she already was.
4	Sophia signaled for the check 
4	and waited fifteen minutes 
4	for the waitress to total her tab.  
4	She walked slowly out of the bar
4	and into the lobby.
4	Sophia sighed when she noticed
4	the client already sitting
4	in a chair, waiting.
4	He rose from his chair
4	and instantly launched into a list
4	of his complaints.
4	Sophia pasted a smile on her face
4	and found herself wishing
5	for the amber beverage she left
6	back in the bar.  
6	She mentally prepared herself for 
6	what was sure to be a difficult meeting.
