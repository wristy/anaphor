1	Delilah and Joseph were in the process
1	of moving from Chicago to London.
1	The biggest remaining task
1	was to pack their apartment.
1	The many smaller items had
1	already been packed. All that remained
1	were a couple of the bigger items.
2	They grabbed the wooden table in the
4	dining room and began to
4	dissemble it together.  Joseph searched
4	the remaining empty boxes
4	for one that was big enough.
4	Glancing at the clock,
4	Delilah realized that their friends
4	would be coming over to help them
4	in twenty minutes.  She looked over at
4	the boxes that Joseph was sorting through.
4	Panicking, she realized that none were big.
4	Joseph grabbed the car keys
4	and headed to the parking lot.
4	He was going to buy a large box
4	at the shipping store across town.
4	He jumped in their car and
4	raced across town.  After two miles,
4	he passed a post office.
4	That reminded him of
4	another task on their list.
4	He ran inside and grabbed a
4	change-of-address form
4	to fill out later.
4	A few miles later, he drove by the bank.
4	He remembered that he needed
4	to get money to pay the movers.
4	He drove through the ATM and withdrew
4	the maximum amount.  Minutes later,
4	he pulled back onto the road
4	and sped to the shipping store.
4	Joseph screeched to a halt
4	in the parking lot.
4	He grabbed their largest packing box,
4	threw his cash at the clerk,
4	and jumped back into the car.
4	Joseph was about to head back
4	to help Delilah pack the pieces of
5	the wooden furniture when his phone rang.
6	It was Delilah calling to let him know
6	that the "reinforcements" had arrived.
