1	The aviation mechanic buried his head
1	in his work rag.  He attempted to
1	soak up some of the sweat
1	streaming down his face.
1	He had forgotten a few of his tools,
1	including the one he needed
1	for this repair.
2	He kicked the plastic chair.
4	He longed for the days
4	when he was part of a
4	line maintenance crew,
4	making the simple checks and adjustments
4	necessary before take-offs.
4	He quickly realized
4	that he didn't have time
4	to vent his frustration
4	even though he wanted to.
4	He was up against a deadline
4	just like he always was.
4	He looked around the hangar.
4	The mechanic took a second to
4	moan over the time he would lose
4	looking for his tool.
4	Then he sprang into action.
4	He was about to run to his car
4	when he tripped over his toolbox.
4	He was thankful that he wouldn't have to
4	run out to his car after all.
4	He bent down to rummage
4	through its contents.
4	It took him only a few seconds
4	to locate the forgotten tool.
4	Rising to his feet,
4	he thought about his problem
4	controlling his temper.
4	He felt foolish for kicking
5	the plastic furniture earlier,
6	when he was frustrated.
6	Experience had told him
6	that simple mistakes
6	were nothing to get upset about.
6	Problems usually
6	resolved themselves in the end.
