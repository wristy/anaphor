1	Delilah and Joseph were in the process
1	of moving from Chicago to London.
1	The biggest remaining task
1	was to pack their apartment.
1	The many smaller items had
1	already been packed. All that remained
1	were a couple of the bigger items.
2	They grabbed the wooden table in the
4	dining room and began to
4	dissemble it together.  Joseph searched
4	the remaining empty boxes
4	for one that was big enough.
4	Glancing at the clock,
4	Delilah realized that their friends
4	would be coming over to help them
4	in three hours.  They had plenty of time.
4	It took half an hour for Joseph
4	to sort through the remaining boxes.
4	None was big enough.  Joseph saw
4	his wife's distress.
4	He needed to find a solution
4	to the problem.  Just then,
4	he remembered something.
4	He told Delilah that he had purchased
4	a large packing box yesterday
4	that he hadn't put with the others.
4	It was just across the hall
4	in their storage locker.
4	Relieved, they decided to enjoy lunch
4	before continuing.  Delilah grabbed
4	the leftovers from the refrigerator,
4	and they sat on the floor
4	and shared a small meal.
4	Tired and full, they laid down
4	for a power nap and were soon asleep.
4	They woke a few hours later.
4	Joseph rubbed the sleep from his eyes
4	and stepped across the hall.
4	It took him awhile to find the large
4	cardboard box in the storage locker.
4	Joseph was about to head back
4	to help Delilah pack the pieces of
5	the wooden furniture when his phone rang.
6	It was Delilah calling to let him know
6	that the "reinforcements" had arrived.
