1	Jason looked around
1	his high school gymnasium.
1	It was overwhelmed by the
1	large number of booths,
1	each representing a different career.
1	He wanted to pursue a career
1	in the field of education
2	as a motivating teacher, so locating that
4	information table was his top priority.
4	Jason was grateful for
4	the opportunity to learn more
4	about a variety of jobs.
4	His class requirement was to distribute
4	a minimum of three resumes
4	and participate in interviews today.
4	Jason opened his bag
4	to remove his resumes.
4	He was irritated to realize
4	that he had forgotten them at home.
4	Unfortunately, his home was several
4	miles away.  Before leaving, however,
4	Jason spent an hour just wandering
4	around the gymnasium
4	looking at the displays.
4	Frustrated he didn't have
4	his resumes to hand out,
4	he exited the gym and began
4	the long walk home. After a mile,
4	he came to a park.
4	He was hot,
4	and purchased an ice cream cone.
4	He sat on the bench and ate it slowly.
4	Feeling tired, he stretched out
4	and took a nap on the bench.
4	When he awoke, he continued his trip.
4	It took another half hour
4	to walk past the high school
4	with its many athletic fields.
4	He was tired when he finally arrived
4	at his house.  He picked through
4	the stack of newspapers
4	on the coffee table.
4	Thirty minutes later, he
4	found his stack of resumes
4	under the papers.
4	Jason was relieved he had
4	the necessary paperwork to start looking
5	into the motivating career he was
6	interested in. 
6	He stuffed the stack of resumes
6	in his bag.
