1	Everyone squeezed into the family room,
1	anxious to begin the treasure hunt,
1	an annual family tradition.
1	Joshua loved the party atmosphere
1	and could hardly wait
1	for the day's activities.
1	Children pushed and giggled
1	and the adults gossiped until
1	the booming voice
2	of the jolly uncle could be
4	heard over the excited crowd.
4	"Everyone knows how this works,"
4	he shouted.  "I've hidden the family trophy.
4	We end today's search at the park next door.
4	Remember, the first one to find it
4	receives the cash prize
4	and bragging rights for a year.
4	Same rules as always!
4	Ready, set... Go!"
4	Joshua's heart fluttered in excitement.
4	The trophy was hidden somewhere
4	in the neighborhood.
4	Joshua needed a method in order to
4	find the treasure first.
4	He wanted to be sure that
4	he wouldn't be followed.
4	After a few minutes,
4	he was able to begin.
4	Leaving the house, he sprinted
4	down several blocks.
4	Joshua skidded around a corner,
4	crouching behind a rock briefly when
4	he spotted some cousins in the distance.
4	He ran past several houses
4	to arrive at the yard with the hollow tree.
4	Climbing the fence,
4	he tore his pants in his haste.
4	Joshua tumbled to the other side
4	and rushed to the tree.
4	Moments later, he was standing
4	on his tiptoes, peering inside.
4	He found the hidden treasure!
4	There was no time to
4	celebrate his victory.
4	Joshua grabbed the family trophy
4	and sprinted to the park
4	three blocks away,
4	shouting his success.
5	The jolly relative rang a large bell
6	to signal the end of the treasure hunt.
6	Once everyone had gathered in the park,
6	he picked up the excited boy and,
6	holding him high,
6	pronounced Joshua the winner.
6	The family surrounded the boy
6	with their congratulations;
6	the younger ones helping Joshua
6	celebrate his new windfall.
6	Still laughing and talking,
6	the family sat at the picnic table
6	for the celebratory meal.
