1	Sophia straightened her suit,
1	took a deep breath,
1	and entered the hotel's bar,
1	just off the lobby.  She took a seat
1	at an empty high-top table.
2	She ordered an amber beer,
4	hoping to calm her nerves.
4	The waitress set Sophia's drink 
4	on the table and moved on.
4	Before Sophia could even take a sip,
4	her cell phone rang.
4	It was the client
4	calling to confirm their meeting
4	in the lobby of the Madison Hotel.
4	The Madison Hotel?
4	Sophia was sitting
4	in the wrong hotel.
4	The Madison was
4	several miles away!
4	Sophia maintained her composure
4	and assured the client
4	that their meeting together
4	would begin in ten minutes.
4	She hung up her phone,
4	grabbed her bag,
4	and raced out of the hotel.
4	It was raining heavily outside.
4	Sophia stopped at
4	the drugstore down the block
4	to buy an umbrella.
4	She quickly completed
4	her purchase and hustled
4	out of the store.
4	She suddenly realized
4	she would never
4	make it in time on foot,
4	so she hailed a cab.
4	It was a good decision:
4	She arrived at the Madison hotel
4	ten minutes later.
4	She was all wet,
4	and dashed into the restroom
4	to freshen up.
4	After a few minutes, 
4	she looked much better. 
4	She hurried through the lobby 
4	where she saw the client 
4	impatiently waiting.  
4	He rose from his chair
4	and instantly launched into a list
4	of his complaints.
4	Sophia pasted a smile on her face
4	and found herself wishing
5	for the amber beverage she left
6	back in the bar.
6	She mentally prepared herself for 
6	what was sure to be a difficult meeting.
