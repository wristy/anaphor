1	The two girls had never been to the zoo.
1	This trip with their father, Jared,
1	would be the first.
1	The girls endlessly reminded their father
2	that they had to see the fierce lion
4	while they were there.
4	Jared reminded his girls
4	of the other animals that they could see
4	but the girls would not be
4	distracted from their goal.
4	Jared helped his girls examine
4	the zoo map at the entrance.
4	The girls giggled as they made it a race
4	to see who could find the exhibit first.
4	Seconds later,
4	the oldest daughter found it.
4	The exhibit was only a few yards away.
4	She grabbed her sister's hand
4	and pulled on Jared's coat.
4	The girls started running.
4	Jared tried to slow them down,
4	but finally gave in
4	to their eagerness with a laugh.
4	He ran after his excited girls.
4	A few minutes later,
4	he caught up with the girls.
4	They stood before the exhibit.
4	Jumping up and down in excitement,
4	the girls could finally see
5	the fierce animal in the distance.
6	After the girls had their fill
6	of looking at that exhibit,
6	they smiled with satisfaction.
6	The zoo had been a success.
