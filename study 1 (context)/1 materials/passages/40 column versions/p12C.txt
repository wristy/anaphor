1	Jason and Jenna smiled at each other.
1	It was a wonderful date so far.
2	They climbed out of the vintage sailboat.
4	They were both hungry and eager
4	for their lunch reservation
4	after spending time on the water.
4	Their reservation was in ten minutes
4	and the restaurant was
4	several miles away.  Jason and Jenna
4	jumped in his convertible
4	and raced through the town.
4	The wind whipped Jenna's hair
4	around her face as Jason disregarded
4	all posted speed limits. 
4	Along the way,
4	they stopped by the drug store.
4	They both needed aloe for their sunburn.
4	There was no time to put it on
4	now, though.  Just then, Jenna
4	remembered that the restaurant
4	did not have a liquor license.
4	They ran across the street and
4	popped into a wine store.
4	There was a large display in front
4	and they grabbed a bottle and
4	paid for it in no time at all.
4	A few minutes later, the convertible
4	screeched into the parking lot
4	of the restaurant.  Jason and Jenna
4	grabbed their wine and rushed inside.
4	As they were shown to their table,
4	Jason asked Jenna which part of
4	their date she liked the best so far.
4	Jenna quickly said
4	that she really enjoyed her time in
5	the vintage vessel.  Then, Jason
6	and Jenna picked up the menu
6	and they prepared to order.
