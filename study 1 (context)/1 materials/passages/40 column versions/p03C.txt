1	Wiping his brow with the kitchen towel,
1	the chef paused for a moment
1	in his preparations to survey the mess
1	he had created.
1	This meal had to be perfect,
1	flawless from the appetizers
1	to the dessert.
1	Not wanting to waste time,
2	he picked up the gleaming knife
4	and continued to cut
4	the vegetables for the salad.
4	The timer sounded, signaling that it was
4	time to apply the herb rub to the roast.
4	Where did he put those spices?
4	How could he have forgotten
4	something like that
4	on such an important day?
4	He must have left them in his catering van.
4	The chef ran through the kitchen
4	and between dozens of tables.
4	In a matter of seconds,
4	he raced through the rented hall
4	until he reached the exit.
4	Bursting out of the double doors,
4	he sprinted past a florist and
4	a pastry shop, and
4	up San Francisco's steepest hill.
4	His van was parked at the very top.
4	After five minutes of running,
4	the chef was becoming very tired.
4	At that moment,
4	he looked to his left
4	and noticed a trolley approaching.
4	The chef grabbed a pole
4	and jumped on the trolley.
4	This mode of transportation
4	allowed him to cover
4	the remaining mile
4	in a matter of minutes.
4	Moments later,
4	the chef hopped off the trolley
4	and sprinted to his van.
4	The chef grabbed the forgotten
4	box of spices and
4	breathed a sigh of relief.
4	Catching his breath
4	and reclaiming his confidence,
4	he could envision
4	how everything would go.  
4	He would first combine the spices in a bowl.
4	Then, he would slide the seasoned roast
4	back into the oven.  Finally, he would use
5	his gleaming utensil to complete
6	the preparations.
6	If tonight was successful,
6	he could look forward to an
6	exciting career in the catering business.
