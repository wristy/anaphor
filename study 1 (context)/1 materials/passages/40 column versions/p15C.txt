1	Jessie was excited to hear the results
1	after her husband's participation
1	in yesterday's competition.
1	She knew that her husband grew
2	the sweetest apples anywhere.
4	The judges had already sampled them
4	at the state fair yesterday
4	and would meet with everyone today
4	to share the results.
4	Jessie entered the competition area.
4	She needed to locate her husband at the
4	judge's table before the judges arrived.
4	Jessie took out her cell phone 
4	and called her husband.
4	She hoped he could give her clear
4	directions to his location.
4	After a brief and tense conversation,
4	she realized that she was on
4	the wrong side of the vast fair!
4	Jessie sprinted back to the parking lot.
4	Five minutes later, she was speeding
4	through the outskirts of the fair.
4	She passed a lemonade stand
4	and paused for two minutes
4	to buy a cool drink.  She gulped it down
4	as she drove off.  Jessie arrived
4	at the correct side of the fairgrounds
4	ten minutes later.
4	She frantically pushed her way through
4	countless brown tables
4	covered in hearty food.
4	She paused only for a moment
4	to use the restroom.  There was no line,
4	and she knew they'd be busy later.
4	Breathless, she joined her husband
4	at the judge's table
4	just in time to see the 
4	three judges approach.
4	Jessie was ecstatic when
5	her husband's sweet fruit was announced
6	as the grand prize winner.
6	She jumped up and down
6	in excitement as the oldest judge
6	handed her husband a blue ribbon!
