1	The two girls had never been to the zoo.
1	This trip with their father, Jared,
1	would be the first.
1	The girls endlessly reminded their father
2	that they had to see the fierce lion
4	while they were there.
4	Jared reminded his girls
4	of the other animals that they could see
4	but the girls would not be
4	distracted from their goal.
4	They rushed around their house
4	as they tried to get ready to go.
4	After five minutes
4	of brushing teeth and combing hair,
4	the family was ready.
4	Traffic was light.
4	The family's minivan covered the five
4	miles to the zoo in just ten minutes.
4	The trip was punctuated
4	by the excited chatter of the girls.
4	They were happy to be spending
4	the day with their father.
4	He sped through the parking lot
4	and pulled into a parking spot
4	right next to the zoo's main entrance.
4	Jared grabbed his girls by their hands
4	and they raced to the exhibit.
4	Jumping up and down in excitement,
4	the girls could finally see
5	the fierce animal in the distance.
6	After the girls had their fill
6	of looking at that exhibit,
6	they smiled with satisfaction.
6	The zoo had been a success.
