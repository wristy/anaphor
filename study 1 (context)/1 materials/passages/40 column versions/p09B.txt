1	Sirens sounded in the distance.
1	The criminal knew
1	the authorities were closing in.
2	He used a rusty hammer to pry open
4	the old basement window.
4	He started to climb out of the window
4	but saw lights, so he retreated back
4	inside. He sprinted through the house.
4	The criminal burst through the front door.
4	He knew he was safe from the authorities
4	because the entrance was
4	completely hidden by tall hedges.
4	He paused for a moment, wondering what
4	he could do to evade the law.
4	Logic dictated that he stick to the shadows
4	and proceed at a slow and deliberate pace,
4	to avoid being discovered.
4	The criminal used his common sense
4	and did not run.  He thought about
4	his options for the next half hour,
4	shielded by the tall hedges.
4	He needed to be smart about
4	what he did next.  His decision could
4	mean the difference between
4	freedom and jail.
4	After lengthy deliberation,
4	the criminal decided it was safest
4	to remain where he was.
4	He retreated even deeper into the hedges.
4	An hour later, he heard sirens.
4	He hoped his hiding spot
4	wouldn't be discovered.  It was too
4	dangerous to do anything now, so
4	he settled in for a nap.
4	He didn't wake until several hours later.
4	The criminal left his hiding place behind
4	and crawled to the house next door.
4	The sun was beginning
4	to rise as he paused 
4	to catch his breath and listen.
4	The criminal decided it was safe
4	to break into the house.
4	He struggled to open a side window.
4	The criminal wished he still had
5	the rusty tool to help him in his efforts.
6	After he got inside, he tiptoed around.
6	When he got to the kitchen
6	his heart sank when he saw two officers
6	waiting to apprehend him.
