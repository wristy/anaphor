1	Jenna sat on the blue couch with a sigh.
1	She was here for the weekend doing a job
1	for Mr. and Mrs. Narayan.
1	Jenna hoped to earn enough
1	for her senior ski trip.
1	All she needed to do was to care for
1	their pets while they were
1	away for the weekend.
1	Jenna's first task was to pick up
2	the Narayan's friendly dog
4	from his vet appointment.
4	She walked outside
4	as small raindrops
4	started to fall.  Jenna didn't
4	want to get too wet.
4	She closed her umbrella
4	and hopped into her Toyota.
4	She would drive to the veterinary clinic,
4	which was all the way across town.
4	She headed off.
4	Five minutes and one mile later,
4	Jenna sped past the bakery.
4	She wished she could stop.
4	Usually, when running errands,
4	she would take a few moments
4	to treat herself.
4	Another five minutes
4	and another mile later,
4	she flew past a pet store
4	that was having a huge sale.
4	Unfortunately, Jenna didn't have time
4	to look inside and purchase treats
4	for the Narayan's animals.  Instead,
4	she continued her trip to the vet.
4	Jenna covered the last few miles
4	in ten short minutes.
4	She screeched into the parking lot
4	of the veterinary clinic and ran inside.
4	She was happy to find there was no line.
4	Jenna hurriedly signed
4	the necessary papers
4	while the receptionist walked
4	into the back of the clinic.
4	Jenna smiled as she saw
5	the friendly animal come galloping
6	into the room.
6	Jenna took the leash
6	from the receptionist
6	and walked outside.
