1	The woman huddled on the floor.  She
1	watched the three men shatter the glass
1	jewelry case with the butts of their guns.
2	The men scooped the glitzy diamonds
4	into black velvet bags.
4	The woman was close to the door that
4	the robbers had carelessly left open.
4	Although scared, she decided to escape
4	and to try to find help.  
4	The woman grabbed her purse and
4	quickly slid across the floor.
4	She launched herself through the doorway.
4	She jumped to her feet
4	and sprinted a mile down the street.
4	Ten minutes later, she came to a bank.
4	She tried to find help,
4	but it was closed.
4	She continued running down the road. 
4	Not finding anyone,
4	she cut across a construction site.
4	She jumped over stacks of lumber
4	and pallets of shingles.
4	A few minutes later, and out of breath,
4	she came to a payphone.
4	It was out of order.
4	She had to find a way to get help!
4	She couldn't help but think
4	of all those other customers
4	in the jewelry store.
4	They were helpless unless she could
4	contact the authorities.  At that moment,
4	she remembered the cell phone
4	in her pocket.  Feeling stupid,
4	she retrieved it and hurriedly dialed 911.
4	Seconds later, she urgently told
4	the operator that a robbery
4	was taking place.  She also
4	mentioned that thieves were grabbing
5	the glitzy gems.  The woman
6	closed her cell phone, exhausted.
6	She breathed a sigh of relief,
6	thankful that she'd been able to escape
6	and call for help.
