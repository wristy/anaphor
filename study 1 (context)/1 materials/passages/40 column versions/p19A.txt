1	The woman huddled on the floor.  She
1	watched the three men shatter the glass
1	jewelry case with the butts of their guns.
2	The men scooped the glitzy diamonds
4	into black velvet bags.
4	The woman was close to the door that
4	the robbers had carelessly left open.
4	Although scared, she decided to escape
4	and to try to find help.  
4	The woman grabbed her purse
4	and quickly slid across the floor.
4	She launched herself through the doorway.
4	Seconds later, she jumped to her feet
4	And scampered around to the
4	side of the building.  She decided
4	she'd be safe hiding there in the shadows.
4	The woman spent a brief minute
4	trying to calm her racing heart.
4	She had to find a way to get help!
4	She couldn't help but think of all those
4	other customers in the jewelry store.
4	They were helpless unless
4	she could contact the authorities.
4	At that moment, she remembered
4	the cell phone in her pocket.
4	Feeling stupid, she retrieved the phone,
4	flipped it open, and hurriedly dialed 911.
4	Seconds later, she told the operator
4	that a robbery was taking place.
4	When asked for the address,
4	she replied that she didn't know. 
4	She also mentioned that thieves were
5	grabbing the glitzy gems.  The woman
6	closed her cell phone, exhausted.
6	She breathed a sigh of relief,
6	thankful that she had been able to escape
6	and call for help.
