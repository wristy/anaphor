1	The aviation mechanic buried his head
1	in his work rag.  He attempted to
1	soak up some of the sweat
1	streaming down his face.
1	He had forgotten a few of his tools,
1	including the one he needed
1	for this repair.
2	He kicked the plastic chair.
4	He longed for the days
4	when he was part of a
4	line maintenance crew,
4	making the simple checks and adjustments
4	necessary before take-offs.
4	There was no time
4	to vent his frustration
4	because he was up against a deadline.
4	He raced out of the hangar.
4	Seconds later, the mechanic started
4	sprinting toward his car
4	in the remote parking lot.
4	That's where he kept his toolbox.
4	He ran past the control tower.
4	He didn't even have time
4	to wave at his friend Sam.
4	A few minutes later,
4	he passed by the main office.
4	Unfortunately, there was no time
4	to pick up his check.
4	He continued past the terminal,
4	dodging travelers. He jogged to his car
4	on the far side of the parking lot.
4	The mechanic spilled
4	the contents of his toolbox
4	and quickly located the forgotten tool.
4	Tired and hot,
4	he thought about his problem
4	controlling his temper.
4	He felt foolish for kicking
5	the plastic furniture earlier,
6	when he was frustrated.
6	Experience had told him
6	that simple mistakes
6	were nothing to get upset about.
6	Problems usually
6	resolved themselves in the end.
