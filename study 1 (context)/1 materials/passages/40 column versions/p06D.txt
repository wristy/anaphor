1	The aviation mechanic buried his head
1	in his work rag.  He attempted to
1	soak up some of the sweat
1	streaming down his face.
1	He had forgotten a few of his tools,
1	including the one he needed
1	for this repair.
2	He kicked the plastic chair.
4	He longed for the days
4	when he was part of a
4	line maintenance crew,
4	making the simple checks and adjustments
4	necessary before take-offs.
4	He was up against a deadline,
4	and he froze with fear.
4	It took him a half hour
4	to calm down.
4	He exited the hangar.
4	He trudged off toward his car
4	in the remote parking lot,
4	where he kept his toolbox.
4	A half hour later, he strolled
4	past the control tower.
4	He paused to dissect last night's game
4	with his friend.  They talked for an hour
4	before Sam had to get back to work.
4	The mechanic walked past the main office
4	to pick up his paycheck.
4	This took a half hour because of
4	all of the paperwork.
4	He then made his way past the terminal,
4	getting caught up in the mob of travelers.
4	He continued to his car
4	on the far side of the parking lot.
4	The mechanic opened the trunk
4	and rummaged through his toolbox.
4	It took forever to locate the forgotten tool.
4	Tired and hot, he thought about his problem
4	controlling his temper.
4	He felt foolish for kicking
5	the plastic furniture earlier,
6	when he was frustrated.
6	Experience had told him
6	that simple mistakes
6	were nothing to get upset about.
6	Problems usually
6	resolved themselves in the end.
