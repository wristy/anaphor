1	Sirens sounded in the distance.
1	The criminal knew
1	the authorities were closing in.
2	He used a rusty hammer to pry open
4	the old basement window.
4	He started to climb out of the window
4	but saw lights, so he retreated back
4	inside. He sprinted through the house.
4	The criminal burst through the front door.
4	He knew he was safe from the authorities
4	because the entrance was
4	completely hidden by tall hedges.
4	He paused for a moment, wondering what
4	he could do to evade the law.
4	Logic dictated that he stick to the shadows
4	and proceed at a slow and deliberate pace,
4	to avoid being discovered.
4	The criminal used his common sense
4	and did not run. He paused for a minute
4	to think about his options.
4	He needed to be smart
4	about what he did next.
4	His decision could mean the difference
4	between freedom and jail.  Seconds later,
4	his thinking was interrupted
4	by the sound of sirens.
4	He decided the safest move
4	was to stay where he was.  The criminal
4	retreated deeper into the hedges.
4	He hoped his hiding spot wouldn't be
4	discovered. The sirens passed moments later.
4	The criminal sprung from his hiding place
4	and raced to the house next door.
4	The moon was shining
4	brightly overhead as he paused 
4	to catch his breath and listen.
4	The criminal decided it was safe
4	to break into the house.
4	He struggled to open a side window.
4	The criminal wished he still had
5	the rusty tool to help him in his efforts.
6	After he got inside, he tiptoed around.
6	When he got to the kitchen
6	his heart sank when he saw two officers
6	waiting to apprehend him.
