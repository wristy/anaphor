1	A soft breeze swirled
1	Tamika's skirt around her ankles.
1	The only sound in the cemetery
1	was the whispering leaves.
1	Tamika wiped a tear from her cheek
1	as she stood by her mother's grave.
1	Her mother's favorite flowers
2	were yellow roses. Tamika placed
4	a bouquet of them on the grave.
4	Her pace quickened
4	as she crossed the street
4	and sprinted to her car.
4	She didn't enjoy returning
4	to her hometown, and wanted to
4	leave as soon as possible. Besides,
4	she was meeting her friend for lunch
4	in the neighboring town.
4	Tamika flew through her hometown
4	in a matter of minutes.
4	At the outskirts, she whipped
4	through a drive through
4	and grabbed a coffee.
4	Tamika ignored the posted speed limits
4	as she continued on her way.
4	The next town was ten minutes away,
4	and she wanted to get there
4	as soon as possible.  Minutes later,
4	Tamika screeched into the parking lot.
4	She dashed from the coolness outside
4	to the warmth of the cafe.
4	There were plenty of open tables.
4	Tamika chose the one closest to the door.
4	Even though it had been a difficult visit,
4	Tamika was happy that she had put
5	the yellow flowers on her mother's grave.
6	She was sure that her mother
6	would enjoy looking down
6	on those beautiful blooms
6	dancing in the breeze.
