1	It was late at night when Ryan,
1	a rookie cop, responded to the call.
1	He was eager to start the process
1	that could eventually lead to an arrest.
1	Ryan scanned the scene.
1	His eyes immediately landed on the
2	gleaming gun lying ominously
4	in the doorway.
4	He reached for his kit
4	for processing crime scenes.
4	Just then, he realized that it was missing.
4	He needed to start remembering to arrive
4	with all his equipment.
4	His scatterbrained ways
4	would get him in trouble some day.
4	They had in the past.
4	Ryan let out a frustrated groan.
4	He panicked for a moment
4	and wondered where his kit could be.
4	There was no way he could collect
4	any evidence without it.  Then,
4	Ryan remembered that he had
4	left the kit in his car.  His superiors
4	hadn't arrived yet, so he sprinted
4	outside to the front yard.
4	It only took a minute.
4	Ryan's car was parked in the driveway.
4	Ryan whipped open the door
4	and climbed inside.  It only took him
4	a few seconds to locate the kit.
4	Ryan breathed a sigh of relief
4	when it was safely in his hand.
4	Mentally, Ryan prepared himself for
4	the next steps he would take
4	in processing the scene.
4	He would start with analyzing
5	the gleaming weapon found at the house.
6	He would have to use the equipment
6	to dust for fingerprints.  Ryan knew
6	that if he worked methodically, his
6	thorough approach would produce results
6	that would help to apprehend the guilty.
