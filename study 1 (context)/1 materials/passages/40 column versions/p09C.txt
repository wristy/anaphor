1	Sirens sounded in the distance.
1	The criminal knew
1	the authorities were closing in.
2	He used a rusty hammer to pry open
4	the old basement window.
4	He started to climb out of the window
4	but saw lights, so he retreated back
4	inside. He sprinted through the house.
4	The criminal burst through the front door.
4	He knew he was safe from the authorities
4	because the entrance was
4	completely hidden by tall hedges.
4	He paused for a moment, wondering what
4	he could do to evade the law.
4	Logic dictated that he stick to the shadows
4	and proceed at a slow and deliberate pace,
4	to avoid being discovered.
4	But the criminal disregarded
4	all common sense and started running.
4	It was the only option.
4	He ran for ten minutes,
4	coming to a wooded area one mile away.
4	The criminal didn't even
4	break his stride as he dodged
4	through the trees.  He ran
4	for ten more minutes, to a park
4	another mile away.  Suddenly,
4	he heard sirens.  He ducked inside
4	a tube slide to hide.  The criminal
4	held his breath,
4	hoping that his hiding spot
4	wouldn't be discovered.
4	When the sirens passed,
4	he left his hiding place behind.
4	He searched the neighborhood
4	for a few minutes until he found
4	a seemingly abandoned house.
4	The moon was shining
4	brightly overhead as he paused 
4	to catch his breath and listen.
4	The criminal decided it was safe
4	to break into the house.
4	He struggled to open a side window.
4	The criminal wished he still had
5	the rusty tool to help him in his efforts.
6	After he got inside, he tiptoed around.
6	When he got to the kitchen
6	his heart sank when he saw two officers
6	waiting to apprehend him.
