1	Jessie was excited to hear the results
1	after her husband's participation
1	in yesterday's competition.
1	She knew that her husband grew
2	the sweetest apples anywhere.
4	The judges had already sampled them
4	at the state fair yesterday
4	and would meet with everyone today
4	to share the results.
4	Jessie entered the competition area.
4	She needed to find her husband
4	so that she could congratulate him
4	when the results were announed.
4	There were so many different displays.
4	Jessie felt overwhelmed by
4	the number of people present today.
4	She needed to find her husband.
4	She wanted to be able to support him
4	when the judges announced the results.
4	Jessie took out her cell phone
4	and called him.  When he picked up,
4	he told her to turn around.
4	When she did, she started laughing
4	as she saw that he was only
4	twenty steps away.
4	She joined her husband and helped him
4	prepare for the arrival of the judges.
4	First, she tried to talk
4	to her husband to calm him down.
4	A half hour later, she realized
4	that that wasn't working.
4	Then she took out a deck of cards and
4	suggested they play a game.
4	Her husband laughed
4	and they spent the next hour
4	playing any silly, mindless game
4	they could think of.
4	Finally, much later,
4	Jessie looked up to see the 
4	three judges approach.
4	Jessie was ecstatic when
5	her husband's sweet fruit was announced
6	as the grand prize winner.
6	She jumped up and down
6	in excitement as the oldest judge
6	handed her husband a blue ribbon!
