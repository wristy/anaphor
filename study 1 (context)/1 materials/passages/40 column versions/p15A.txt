1	Jessie was excited to hear the results
1	after her husband's participation
1	in yesterday's competition.
1	She knew that her husband grew
2	the sweetest apples anywhere.
4	The judges had already sampled them
4	at the state fair yesterday
4	and would meet with everyone today
4	to share the results.
4	Jessie entered the competition area.
4	She needed to locate her husband at the
4	judge's table before the judges arrived.
4	There were so many different displays.
4	Jessie felt overwhelmed.
4	She didn't like navigating
4	through unfamiliar areas.
4	Hundreds of people moved
4	through countless brown tables
4	covered in hearty food.
4	If she didn't find her husband
4	at the judge's table soon,
4	she might miss her opportunity
4	to congratulate him when the judges
4	announced the results.  Additionally,
4	she knew how much her presence
4	would mean to him.
4	Jessie took out her cell phone
4	and called her husband.
4	Oddly enough, she heard a phone ringing
4	with her husband's unique ring tone
4	from somewhere close behind her.
4	Jessie turned around and laughed
4	when she saw that her husband
4	was only twenty steps away
4	from where she was standing.
4	Seconds later, Jessie arrived
4	at the judge's table.
4	She was just in time to see the
4	three judges approach.
4	Jessie was ecstatic when
5	her husband's sweet fruit was announced
6	as the grand prize winner.
6	She jumped up and down
6	in excitement as the oldest judge
6	handed her husband a blue ribbon!
