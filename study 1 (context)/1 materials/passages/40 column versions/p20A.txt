1	The warrior sprung from
1	his afternoon nap, ready for the battle
1	that was a half hour away.
2	He threw on his wool shirt,
4	bothered not at all by its
4	tattered condition or egregious smell.
4	Many thoughts raced through his mind.
4	He had fought many battles in his life,
4	and had come close to dying several times.
4	Today's battle was just a game, however;
4	a competition to determine
4	the best man in the land.
4	He had fought many men over the years,
4	many stronger than him.  He had
4	vanquished them all because combat is
4	not about deploying one's strengths.
4	Rather, it is about exploiting your
4	opponent's weaknesses.  These thoughts
4	flowed through his mind. The warrior
4	was hungry for a quick meal.  He rifled
4	through his stack of provisions.
4	The warrior sat down to a bit of ale
4	and an old drumstick.
4	This was his traditional meal before battle.
4	He had actually come to hate drumsticks,
4	but was far too superstitious to 
4	change his menu at this point in his life.
4	The warrior rapidly devoured the few morsels
4	for the energy they provided.  He finished
4	the meal in a matter of minutes.
4	He then pushed his chair back from 
4	the table.  He walked to the large bowl of
4	water in the corner and dropped to his knees.
4	The warrior sank his hands into the water.
4	He then wiped his soiled fingers
5	on his wool clothing.  Finally,
6	he changed into his armor
6	and prepared himself for battle.
