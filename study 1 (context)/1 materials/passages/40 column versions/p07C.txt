1	Jason looked around
1	his high school gymnasium.
1	It was overwhelmed by the
1	large number of booths,
1	each representing a different career.
1	He wanted to pursue a career
1	in the field of education
2	as a motivating teacher, so locating that
4	information table was his top priority.
4	Jason was grateful for
4	the opportunity to learn more
4	about a variety of jobs.
4	His class requirement was to distribute
4	a minimum of three resumes
4	and participate in interviews today.
4	Jason opened his bag
4	to remove his resumes.
4	He was irritated to realize that
4	he had forgotten them at home.
4	Unfortunately, his home
4	was several miles away.
4	Jason was frustrated, but at least he had
4	driven to the school rather than walked.
4	He sprinted out of the gymnasium
4	and jumped in his car.  Seconds later,
4	he was speeding through town.
4	Five minutes later, he came to
4	a fork in the road.
4	He decided to cut through the city park.
4	This enabled him to
4	avoid the traffic downtown.
4	He emerged on the other side of the park
4	a few minutes later.
4	Next, he came to the high school
4	and its athletic fields.
4	He sped past them in less than a minute.
4	Jason screeched to a halt
4	in front of his house and ran inside.
4	On one side of the coffee table
4	was a stack of newspapers.  He 
4	found his stack of resumes
4	under the papers.
4	Jason was relieved he had
4	the necessary paperwork to start looking
5	into the motivating career he was
6	interested in. 
6	He stuffed the stack of resumes
6	in his bag.
