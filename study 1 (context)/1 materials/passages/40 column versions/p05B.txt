1	The two girls had never been to the zoo.
1	This trip with their father, Jared,
1	would be the first.
1	The girls endlessly reminded their father
2	that they had to see the fierce lion
4	while they were there.
4	Jared reminded his girls
4	of the other animals that they could see
4	but the girls would not be
4	distracted from their goal.
4	Jared helped his girls examine
4	the zoo map at the entrance.
4	The girls giggled as they
4	made it a race to see
4	who could find the exhibit first.
4	Jared saw this as an opportunity.
4	He spent the next hour teaching
4	the girls how to read a map.
4	The girls turned it into a game
4	and asked Jared to quiz them
4	by asking them to find
4	different locations on the map.
4	An hour passed before the older girl
4	finally found the exhibit.
4	The exhibit was only a few yards away.
4	She grabbed her younger sister's hand
4	and pulled on Jared's coat.
4	The girls started running but then
4	Jared called for them to slow down.
4	Rounding a bend,
4	they came to the exhibit.
4	Jumping up and down in excitement,
4	the girls could finally see
5	the fierce animal in the distance.
6	After the girls had their fill
6	of looking at that exhibit,
6	they smiled with satisfaction.
6	The zoo had been a success.
