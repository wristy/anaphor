1	The warrior sprung from his
1	afternoon nap, ready for the battle
1	that was a half hour away.    
2	He threw on his wool shirt,
4	bothered not at all by its
4	tattered condition or egregious smell.
4	Many thoughts raced through his mind.
4	He had fought many battles in his life,
4	and had come close to dying several times.
4	Today's battle was just a game, however;
4	a competition to determine
4	the best man in the land.  He had fought
4	many men over the years,
4	many stronger than him.  He had vanquished
4	them all because combat is not about 
4	deploying one's strengths.  Rather,
4	it is about exploiting your opponent's
4	weaknesses.  These thoughts flowed
4	through his mind.
4	The warrior was hungry for a quick meal.
4	He raced through the village 
4	in search of his favorite inn.
4	The warrior sat down to a bit of ale 
4	and an old drumstick.
4	This was his traditional meal before battle.
4	He had actually come to hate drumsticks,
4	but was far too superstitious to change
4	his menu at this point in his life.
4	He rapidly devoured the few morsels
4	for the energy they provided.
4	He finished the meal in a matter of minutes.
4	He then continued his journey.
4	A few minutes later,
4	he stopped beside a peaceful brook.  
4	The warrior sank his hands into the water.
4	He then wiped his soiled fingers
5	on his wool clothing.  Finally,
6	he changed into his armor
6	and prepared himself for battle.
