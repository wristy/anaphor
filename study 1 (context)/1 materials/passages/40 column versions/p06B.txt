1	The aviation mechanic buried his head
1	in his work rag.  He attempted to
1	soak up some of the sweat
1	streaming down his face.
1	He had forgotten a few of his tools,
1	including the one he needed
1	for this repair.
2	He kicked the plastic chair.
4	He longed for the days
4	when he was part of a
4	line maintenance crew,
4	making the simple checks and adjustments
4	necessary before take-offs.
4	He was up against a deadline,
4	and he froze with fear.
4	It took him a half hour to calm down.
4	The mechanic looked around the hangar.
4	He spent several minutes
4	mourning the time he would lose
4	looking for his tool.  Eventually,
4	he forced himself into action.
4	The mechanic was about to trudge off
4	toward his car when he tripped
4	over his toolbox.
4	As he got back to his feet,
4	he saw his friend Sam
4	walking over for a visit.
4	They spent a couple of hours
4	dissecting last night's game.
4	When Sam finally left,
4	the mechanic bent down
4	to rummage through his toolbox.
4	It took forever
4	to locate the forgotten tool.
4	Tired and hot, he rose to his feet.
4	He thought about his problem
4	controlling his temper.
4	He felt foolish for kicking
5	the plastic furniture earlier,
6	when he was frustrated.
6	Experience had told him
6	that simple mistakes
6	were nothing to get upset about.
6	Problems usually
6	resolved themselves in the end.
