1	The woman huddled on the floor.  She
1	watched the three men shatter the glass
1	jewelry case with the butts of their guns.
2	The men scooped the glitzy diamonds
4	into black velvet bags.
4	The woman was close to the door that
4	the robbers had carelessly left open.
4	Although scared, she decided to escape
4	and to try to find help.  
4	The woman grabbed her purse and slowly
4	crawled across the floor.
4	A half hour passed before the robbers
4	were distracted enough for her to pass
4	through the door frame.
4	She crawled slowly, careful to avoid
4	jostling the door.  Once outside,
4	she carefully made her way
4	to the side of the building.
4	The woman decided she'd be safe
4	hiding there in the shadows.
4	She spent the next half hour
4	trying to calm her racing heart.
4	In her panic, the woman couldn't seem
4	to catch her breath.
4	She was hyperventilating!
4	The combination of the crime and
4	the heat got the best of her,
4	and she passed out.
4	She awoke two hours later.
4	Finally, she remembered
4	the cell phone in her pocket.
4	She retrieved it and carefully
4	dialed 911. A little while later,
4	she told the operator
4	that a robbery had taken place. 
4	She also mentioned that thieves
5	had taken glitzy gems.  The woman
6	closed her cell phone, exhausted.
6	She breathed a sigh of relief,
6	thankful that she had been able to escape
6	and call for help.
