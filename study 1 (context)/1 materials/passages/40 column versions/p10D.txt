1	Following the doctor's visit,
1	the tension in the hospital room
1	was palpable.  All the parents
1	could hear was the echo of the doctor's
1	diagnosis: their daughter was battling
2	an aggressive cancer.  There was so
4	much sadness here.  Of course,
4	it could have been worse.
4	The parents were eager to do something
4	to cheer up their daughter.
4	They decided to find something that
4	would make her smile when she woke up.
4	The father remembered the gift store
4	that he and his wife had seen.
4	The father decided to buy their daughter
4	a new teddy bear.
4	His wife asked him to go
4	to the gift store that was
4	several blocks away.  She could see
4	that he was emotionally drained,
4	and thought he could use
4	a couple of hours to regain his strength.
4	The father plodded through the 7th floor
4	of the hospital in a state of shock.
4	He waited a long time for the elevator.
4	When he finally got to the lobby,
4	he saw his neighbors holding
4	colorful balloons for his daughter.
4	The father broke the devastating news
4	to the group.  It took an hour to answer
4	all of their questions. When he finished,
4	he exited the hospital.
4	He slowly walked the several blocks
4	to the gift store.
4	When he finally arrived,
4	he found the place packed with customers.
4	His purchase took a half hour.
4	As he exited the store,
4	he tucked the teddy bear under his arm
4	and took a deep breath.
4	He knew they could be strong
4	as they fought this 
5	aggressive disease as a family.
6	Together, they would
6	make it through this.
